Historian Ruth Goodman and archaeologists Alex Langlands and Peter Ginn move into a Victorian smallholding on the Acton Scott estate in Shropshire, to live the life of Victorian farmers for a year. Their first task is the restoration of the cottage, including the installation of a new range. They also help thresh the previous summer's wheat crop, learn shepherding, make cider and try out Victorian cooking.
