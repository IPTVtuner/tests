Kierti Vaidyya, 33, gave up her city lifestyle last year to farm South American alpacas in Warwickshire. However, her farm is standing empty after she built her farm house without planning permission and the council have forced her to leave. Monty Don is on hand to help her bring life back to her land. Monty soon finds Kierti's problems run much deeper than a spat with the council and prescribes radical measures.
