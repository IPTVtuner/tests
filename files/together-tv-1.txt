Albury Park is one of Surrey's most important and prestigious country houses, renowned for its great architecture, first by Sir John Soane and later by Augustus Pugin, who designed the Houses of Parliament. The Grade II listed Tudor mansion has one of the first cantilevered staircases and an amazing 63 individually designed chimneys. Nigel and Jennifer Whalley live at Albury Park and bought it four years ago.
