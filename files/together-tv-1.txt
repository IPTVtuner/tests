Sean and Beverly have to retrieve Matt from a seedy bar in the outskirts of LA so that the paparazzo waiting outside won't see him driving home drunk. What follows is an all-night road trip which takes the trio from a run-in with the paparazzo, to Matt's ex-wife's house and finally to his sons' bedroom where Matt is forced to confront the mess he's made of his life.
