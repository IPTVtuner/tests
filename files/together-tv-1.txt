Ruth Watson visits Pen-y-Lan, a 17-century mansion in Wales. The house was built in 1690 by the founder of Lloyds bank and was bought by the Holloway family in 1849. The house has been passed through the generations. Emma Holloway grew up in the house and has, in turn, brought up her four children there. To Emma, Pen-y-Lan is her life, but the house is a noose around Emma's neck with a debt of £300,000.
