Pentillie estate in Cornwall is made up of 1,500 acres of farmland and woods along a large stretch of the banks of the River Tamar. The house is a small, eight-bedroom castle with views across the valley and gardens, created by renowned landscape designer Humphrey Repton. For the past three decades Ted Coryton has lived in a farm across the valley from the castle, knowing that one day he would inherit it.
