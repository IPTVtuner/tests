However, when they meet him at a swanky LA dinner party at Merc's house, Matt couldn't be more charming or flattering about their show. Unfortunately, over time the natural animosity between Matt and Beverly rises to the surface, and Beverly learns just how much you don't want the former `Friend' as an enemy.
