John and Vanessa want a garden reminiscent of Oman, the desert kingdom where they first met. The large raised planter right outside the back doors, nicknamed the sarcophagus, is outdated and dominates the garden, and John and Vanessa are desperate for it to go, but they are keen for the materials to be reused to make the most of their Â£4,000 budget. John loves a fire, and the couple love to entertain, so they need space for an area in which to socialise.
