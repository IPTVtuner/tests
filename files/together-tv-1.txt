The team tackles the conditions faced by British farmers in 1943, when food imports slumped to their lowest level during the War. The government feared a crisis and Britain's farmers were challenged with somehow increasing food production yet again. There were renewed shortages of animal feed so Alex and Peter use some clever 1940s technology to produce a hay crop from grass in the church yard.
