Today, November 11
Clive, 45, an IT engineer, and Rosie, 29, are still virgins - and not through choice. Clive is intimidated by the thought of physical intimacy and finds it hard to chat to women, let alone sleep with them. Rosie dreams of marriage and children of her own, but can't bear to be touched by, or touch, men. Rosie thinks men smell like a cross between aftershave and ham. Follow them as they lose their virginity.
