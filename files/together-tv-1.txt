Black Clauchrie has been part of the wild Galloway landscape since 1901. Designed in the Arts and Crafts style, the house was originally a shooting lodge for a wealthy couple who wanted to enjoy country pursuits. Caroline and Adrian Goodall bought this remote house just over four years ago, but renovations to Black Clauchrie cost them thousands, which forced them into letting the house out to groups.
