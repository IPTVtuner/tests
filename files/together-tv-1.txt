Ruth heads for Riverhill in Kent, home to the Rogers family. Riverhill House is an 18th-century rag stone manor set in 130 acres of historic gardens. Four generations of the Rogers family live at Riverhill. Great Grandmother Evelyn Rogers has lived in the grounds since the end of World War II and at 87 is the matriarch of the family. Over 60 years she's seen the once magnificent treasured estate fall into disrepair.
