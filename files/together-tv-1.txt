Ruth visits Abbey Dore Court, a quaint country house with a big problem. Set in 150 acres of Herefordshire farmland, the house was bought by Charis Ward in 1967 for £12,000. Up until ten years ago the house was a happy home where Charis's children and grand children grew up. However, in 2000 Charis decided to leave Abbey Dore to live in a more manageable property, and the house has since fallen into disrepair.
