August brings the climax of the farming year - and the end of 12 months on the Edwardian Farm for the team. Their last challenge is to harvest their oat crop, but everything depends on the weather. To celebrate the end of harvest, the whole town enjoys a grand fete sporting new innovations such as the electric light bulb, the latest threshing machines, the petrol-powered Lister engine and a genuine flying machine.
