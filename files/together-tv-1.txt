This week we travel across the Dales with midwife Chris Warren as she goes to meet a mum-to-be in Masham. Chris takes on the challenges of the Dales year upon year to reach patients despite some treacherous weather conditions and winding roads. We also meet the Swale Valley Stompers - a veteran jazz band based near the Dales' north eastern edge.
