Greg and Charlotte live in Moreton-in-Marsh in the picture-perfect Cotswolds. Their garden is functional but lacks character, and they dream of a space that works for them and their two children, Winter and Albert. Their ideal garden would be country cottage-themed and reflect the Cotswolds while also providing zones for the children and a bar for them to enjoy sundowners. Can Arit and the Rich Brothers make this happen on a budget of Â£4,500?
