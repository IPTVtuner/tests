Eleanor and Rob from Hereford would love an eco-friendly garden for themselves and their two daughters to enjoy. Of primary importance to the couple is that their garden is low/no carbon and that it is friendly to the environment. They would like the garden build to be based on a `circular economy' ie. any carbon spent would be offset by reusing materials. They want lots of habitats for birds, butterflies and bees and to use as many natural materials as possible.
