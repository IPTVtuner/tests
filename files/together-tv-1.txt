Riya and Nanda have a sad and unloved garden in Groby, with an outdated pink and yellow `Battenburg' patio, a tumbledown shed and a huge gravel slope. This really is a plot that needs to be rescued, especially as Riya is soon to be married, and they are hoping to host some of the celebrations in the garden. Desperate for some inspiration, they've asked the team to create a garden fit for the upcoming nuptials.
