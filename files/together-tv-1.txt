Angus wants a garden that reminds him of his favourite holiday destination, Cyprus. Currently, he hates his awkwardly shaped plot and absolutely loathes the domineering dark grey retaining wall, which he thinks makes the space look like a prison yard. Angus loves to barbecue and would like a generous, Cypriot-inspired space where he can entertain his friends. He is also keen to try and grow his own produce. Can Flo and Lee make his Mediterranean island dreams come true with a budget of Â£6,000?
