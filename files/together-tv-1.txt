In this Christmas special, James May gets to the heart of the nation's childhood love affair with the model plane and sets out to achieve what seems an impossible dream: the first cross channel flight ever achieved by an engineless, homemade supersized toy. If it survives the perilous 22 mile journey, James' classic toy glider, lovingly built from over 1,000 pieces of balsa, will smash the British distance record.
