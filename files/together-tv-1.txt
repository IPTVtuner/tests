Ruth Goodman, Alex Langlands and Peter Ginn return to the Acton Scott estate in Shropshire to celebrate a traditional Christmas. There's farm work to be done before the festive season, including the hay harvest. Peter travels to the Royal Agricultural Society's annual show with sheep expert Richard Spencer to choose a new ram; back at the farm, Ruth makes mincemeat for the Christmas mince pies.
