Monreith House is an imposing Georgian mansion built in 1799 near Port William in south west Scotland. It is home to Sir Michael Maxwell, the last in line to one of Scotland's oldest families who can be traced back to 1481. Sir Michael inherited Monreith in the early 1980s from his uncle. The house was in state of disrepair, his attempts at renting out holiday homes to pay the bills have been disastrous.
