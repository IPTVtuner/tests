Father Ted receives word that the Holy Stone of Clonrichert, Craggy Island's most popular religious knick-knack, is to be upgraded to a Class II relic. Three bishops arrive on the island to perform the solemn ceremony and Father Ted is determined that Father Dougal and Father Jack be on their best behaviour.
