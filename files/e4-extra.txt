Today, December 07
Kara, 25, is moving out of her house in Reading and leaving the keys in the tattooed hands of her 22-year-old fianc√©, Alex. Kara is petrified about leaving him home alone in her house, especially as he has a reputation of partying hard and being so bad with money that she even has to babysit his bankcard. Alex is a care worker and has never organised anything this big before.
