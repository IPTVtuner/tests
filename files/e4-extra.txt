Gordon travels to Orange County, Southern California, to try to save an Italian restaurant from imminent destruction. Luigi's was a successful restaurant with a great reputation until Dominic decided to retire to Italy and brought in son Tony to help run it. Familial fighting and an unappetising menu of 126 items have let the restaurant down the drain. Can Gordon fix it, or is Luigi's beyond repair?
