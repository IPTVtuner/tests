Today, December 16
When Barney asks Ted to go with him to see a Robots Versus Wrestlers show, Ted is unsure of what to do and is given guidance by two versions of himself from the future, assisted by a couple of future-era Barneys. Meanwhile, Marshall challenges Robin to a dance-off when they fall out over who should take the credit for the invention of a new cocktail at McLaren's bar.
