E4 Extra
Today, November 19
Ted, having lost a bet to Dick Byrne, has to kick Bishop Brennan in the behind as his forfeit. Coincidentally, Bishop Brennan and his side-kick, Father Jessup, arrive at the Craggy Island Parochial House to see the image of the Bishop which has miraculously appeared on the skirting board of Ted's spare room. Ted now has no excuse but to carry out the forfeit.
