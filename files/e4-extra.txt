E4 Extra
Today, March 12
Gloucester rugby lad Josh is desperate to please his demanding bride-to-be, Stacie. They met five years ago in a nightclub and Josh popped the question in 2010. Money is tight, so they are given Â£12,000 pounds for their big day. However, they have agreed that Josh will arrange the wedding on his own and Stacie won't know a single thing until the big day in three weeks' time.
