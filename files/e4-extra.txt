The arrival of Katie and Darnell's two daughters has put their wedding plans on hold. They can claim Â£12,000 towards their big day, but only on the condition that Darnell organises the whole wedding on his own. The couple will have no contact and three weeks apart, with Katie not knowing a single thing about the wedding until the big day.
