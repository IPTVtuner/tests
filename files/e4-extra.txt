Rocker and tattoo artist Martyn takes control of his wedding to model and bride-to-be Terri. Martyn fell for his young bride after seeing her modelling underwear on the catwalk. Three years later, Terri is now running Martyn's tattoo parlour and his life. When it comes to their wedding, obsessively organised and bossy `princess' Terri expects nothing less than the fairytale wedding of her dreams.
