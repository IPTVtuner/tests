Today, March 17
Mark makes a final play for Dobby, the object of his desires, while Jeremy meets Elena, a Russian émigré who loves music and poetry. Both men are determined to impress, but one of them is an expectant father. When the pregnant Sophie spills the beans, both Mark and Jeremy's worlds change forever; worse still, the new boiler is playing up.
