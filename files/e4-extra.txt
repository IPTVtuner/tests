E4 Extra
Today, September 23
Barney approaches a personal milestone; sleeping with the first woman he hits on seven nights in a row. However, is Barney using this to cover a bigger problem? Elsewhere, Lily and Marshall realise that they've been using the same toothbrush, Robin waits to hear back from a date and Ted insults one of his students.
