Nick and Laila are madly in love and have been engaged for two years. It would have taken them years to save up for Laila's dream wedding day, instead they will receive Â£12,000 towards their big day and a chance for Nick to prove himself to the woman he loves. They have agreed that Nick will organise the wedding alone and the bride won't know a single thing about it until the big day.
