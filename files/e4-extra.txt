E4 Extra
Today, November 13
Hardworking Hayley is plunged out of her depth when she hands over control of her big day to a man with a crazy underwater plan. Her fiance Ian has just three weeks and Â£12,000 to pull off the wedding of a lifetime. Working as a sports physio, Hayley dreams of hanging up her tracksuit and becoming a gypsy princess, but hopeless romantic Ian wants to throw her in at the deep end of their local leisure centre.
