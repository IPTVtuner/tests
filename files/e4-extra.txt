E4 Extra
Today, April 02
Emma and Patrick are childhood sweethearts, but lack of funds means that Emma has been waiting nearly 10 years to get Patrick up the aisle. So, they are given Â£12,000 pounds towards their big day and a chance for Patrick to prove himself to the woman he loves. However, there's a catch - they have both agreed in the presence of a lawyer that Patrick must organise the wedding alone.
