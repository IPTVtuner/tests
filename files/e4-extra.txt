Today, December 09
Lily goes into labour while Marshall is in Atlantic City with Barney, so Ted and Robin try to distract her from the painful contractions by telling her amusing stories from the group's past. As a drunken Marshall and Barney desperately try to get back home to New York, Lily becomes more panic-stricken until her father, Mickey, shows up at the hospital to comfort her.
