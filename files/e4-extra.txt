E4 Extra
Today, June 26
For the last 18 months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. With debts of Â£100k, Gordon forces him to face his failures, strips down the menu and dismantles the claustrophobic dining room.
