E4 Extra
Today, January 14
Gallant groom David has just three weeks and Â£12,000 to organise a wedding for bride-to-be Kelly. As a young girl Kelly always dreamed of being a dancer, but her dreams were cut short by illness. So Kelly just wants a small intimate wedding with a few friends and family where, for a day, she can forget about her condition. But David wants a day with Kelly at the very centre of attention.
