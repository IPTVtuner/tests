Today, November 23
Another brave bride leaves the most important day of her life in the hands of the man she loves. Harry Potter fan Sean needs all the help he can get planning a spooky witches and wizards-themed wedding in a forest for his demanding bride-to-be Nicole. But with a fiancee set on a church for her big day and a best man who'd rather watch football than plan a wedding, will Sean be able to work his magic to pull off a spellbinding day to remember or will it all be just an illusion?
