Fashion-conscious Holly Binnington gives full control of her wedding to her logical space cadet beau Anthony Richardson. Within months of meeting, they knew that their future together was written in the stars and Holly immediately planned her elegant Italian dream wedding. Unfortunately Holly's plans were called off, so now Anthony has just three weeks and Â£12,000 to give Holly a wedding that's truly out of this world.
