Mum's excited about the new curtains, but the boys and Grandma think they're horrible, so Mum is annoyed. Meanwhile, Dad drops Mum's beef casserole all over the kitchen floor and it looks disgusting. Dad scoops it back into the dish, but the boys are not happy about their meal. Later, the argument about the curtains spreads, and Jonny leaves in a huff to go to the pub.
