E4 Extra
Today, March 24
The venue for this edition is D-Place in Chelmsford, run by Mexican-born Israel and his English partner Tara. They've sunk £150,000 of their own money into their trendy café bar, which offers a vast selection of fusion cuisine. In charge is executive chef Philippe, producing everything from all-day breakfasts to Hoi Sin noodles with an astounding lack of flair.
