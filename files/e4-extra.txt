Ted invites his old university professor, who insisted he would never make it as an architect, to the grand opening of the GNB building. When the professor snubs Ted by returning the invitation, saying he doesn't know who he is, Ted goes back to the campus to confront him. He takes the gang along for old time's sake, but while there Lily and Marshall run into an old acquaintance they would rather avoid.
