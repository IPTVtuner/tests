John and his fianc√©e Jackie live in Kirkintilloch, an old mining town on the outskirts of Glasgow. Country boy John was born there and has never left, but city girl Jackie hails from Glasgow's West End and has always dreamt of a sophisticated and glamorous wedding. John has his head in the clouds for his bride's big day and wants to throw Jackie out of a plane at 10,000 feet on the morning of her wedding.
