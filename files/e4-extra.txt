Adam comes home to find the house looking immaculate, with classical music playing in the living room, Mum's posh bowls on the dinner table, Dad in a smart suit, and most mysteriously - the table is set for five. The doorbell rings and in comes Tanya Green, a girl Mum has been trying to fix up with Adam for months. What follows is possibly the most excruciating family dinner scene of all time.
