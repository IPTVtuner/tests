Gordon takes on The Priory, a 100-seater carvery in Haywards Heath, Sussex. It's owned by ex-IT consultant Scott and located in a beautiful former convent, offering bargain roast dinners. Scott bought the place for £300,000, but with an ageing clientele eating for half price, he's losing £5,000 a week. Despite the heavenly location, the food is straight from hell.
