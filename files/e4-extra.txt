E4 Extra
Today, April 17
As Mark's best man, Jeremy has organised a stag weekend consisting of Mark and Jeremy on a canal boat on the Shropshire Union Canal. Unfortunately, it's cold, there's nothing to do, and Jeremy is instantly bored, but things soon spice up when Jeremy meets a new girl, then does something unspeakable to her pet dog. Later, Mark gets offered an exciting new job in India, possibly being his way out of marriage to Sophie.
