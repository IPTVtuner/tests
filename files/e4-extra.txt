E4 Extra
Today, August 02
Richard Ayoade is joined by Jo Brand for a fast, funny and ruthlessly efficient two days in Venice. In almost no time the pair learn to row a gondola, see the city's most famous sights, trial an interactive tour, sample the Venetian version of tapas, and explore the world of masks.
