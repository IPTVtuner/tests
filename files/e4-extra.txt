Today, February 17
Sean and Laura are madly in love, have been engaged for seven years but can't save enough money for Laura's dream wedding. They are given £12,000 towards their big day, but the catch is that Sean must organise the wedding alone. They will have no contact and Laura won't know a single thing about her wedding until the big day three weeks later. Will Sean get the wedding dress on time?
