The pressure is on for 30-year-old sci-fi fanatic Charles as he tries to impress his more classy bride-to-be, 26-year-old Lauren. Originally both from Yorkshire, they met five years ago when they worked behind a bar in Newcastle and have been inseparable ever since. Lauren is an art teacher with very sophisticated tastes and prefers the finer things in life, whereas Charles is an only child who has never grown up.
