Today, July 31
Roy, Moss and Jen return for more adventures as the unappreciated IT department at Reynholm Industries. When the dashing Philip from the sixth floor pops in to ask Jen to the theatre, she accepts right away, but to her annoyance, so do Moss and Roy, turning what could have been a date into a work outing. As the evening spirals towards disaster, she wonders whether Philip is everything he claims to be.
