Car-mad groom Adam has just three weeks and Â£12,000 to organise his entire wedding to bride-to-be Victoria. While Victoria has always wanted a wedding steeped in romance and dripping with gothic grandeur, all Adam wants is to bring the two loves in his life - Victoria and his car - together for a revved-up ceremony.
