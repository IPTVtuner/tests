E4 Extra
Today, March 26
Ritesh and Sheena are in love but simply don't have the funds for a wedding, having ploughed all their pennies into their ice-cream business. They have been given Â£12,000 towards their big day, but there is a catch - not only will the wedding be arranged in just three weeks, but every single decision will be made by the groom and his bride will know nothing until the big day.
