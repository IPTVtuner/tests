Breda and Paddy's love story began two years ago and over 8000 miles away in Australia. Now the couple live in Cashel with their baby daughter Emily. Paddy predicted that organising the perfect wedding would be a walk in the park, but with a ceremony in a bog, a reception venue filled with snakes and kangaroos, and the bride is arriving to her wedding on a turf cutter, will Paddy really pull off Breda's dream wedding, or will this day get dragged through the mud?
