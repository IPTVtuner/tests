James, the groom who confesses he doesn't actually want a wedding, plans the biggest day of bride-to-be Hollie's life. Whilst she dreams of a local church wedding back home in rural Lincolnshire, James wants a rooftop party in a multi-story car park in Peckham. In an attempt to avoid all things traditional, will this groom forget he's even planning a wedding? And will his gritty, urban vision for their big day be bold or leave his bride cold?
