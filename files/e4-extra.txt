E4 Extra
Today, December 16
The Goodmans are a family who have made an art form of their eccentricities. In this first episode, mum and dad are having a clear-out, but dad is reluctant to chuck away all his old magazines roping in Jonny to secretly hide the stash back at his flat. Later, Dad has forgotten to come and pick up their old sofabed and as they carry it downstairs, it gets stuck on the staircase.
