E4 Extra
Today, April 01
Stuart and Vicki are madly in love and desperate to get hitched, but can't find the funds. They are given Â£12,000 towards their big day, but the catch is that Stuart must organise the wedding alone. They will have no contact and Vicki won't know a single thing about her wedding until the big day three weeks later. Will music lover Stuart remember it is a wedding he is planning, not a concert?
