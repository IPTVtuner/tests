Dubliners Tracey and Peter have been together for 6 years after meeting online. Tracey is the organiser in the relationship and Peter is the complete opposite to her. He is a scatterbrain and really laid back. Aside from Tracey and their 2 year old son the big love of his life is football. With some advice from a naked stranger, a dodgy wedding veil, a sports club reception, can this football crazy groom really make this bride's dreams come true?
