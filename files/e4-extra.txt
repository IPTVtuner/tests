Stella's sister is jilted four days before her wedding. Angry at the amount of money spent on the ceremony that she can no longer get back, Stella offers for she and Ted to take over the wedding and pay her sister so she doesn't lose out financially. Ted and Stella prepare for the service but when their ex-partners turn up, old feelings are stirred.
