E4 Extra
Today, January 09
Two women are interested in Ted and both want to go back to his flat which leaves Barney seething, and Robin goes out on a date with unshaved legs so that she won't be tempted to sleep with him. The date goes well and after bribing a waitress to buy her a razor, Robin knocks herself unconscious frantically trying to shave her legs in the toilet.
