In Atlanta, Gordon helps first-time restaurant owners Richard and Jorge. Their restaurant, Park's Edge, has been open for three years but is in big trouble due to constant fighting between them, poor food and a bad vibe in the tight-knit neighbourhood. Gordon comes up with a brilliant plan to resolve the issue within the community, but then a rogue chef threatens to ruin everything.
