Today, October 20
Barney can't stop thinking about Quinn and tracks her down at the strip club where she works. After she gets a lot of money out of him in tips, he realises that she is manipulating him and feels this is payback time for the way he has treated women in the past. Ted is still upset about Robin moving out and can't work out what to do with her old room.
