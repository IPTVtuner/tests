The Granary in rural Hampshire is an upmarket restaurant, which at 200 seats, is the biggest Gordon's ever taken on. Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an upmarket dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a £2 million refit, but it's still losing £4,000 a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the menu features food sourced from all over the globe.
