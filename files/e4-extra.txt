E4 Extra
Today, January 02
Presumed dead, the sisters start their demon-free existence with new identities brought about by a spell that altered their appearances to the outside world, but not to those closest to them. Phoebe is surprised to see Dex Lawson, and now able to have a normal family life, Piper remains paranoid that the demons will find out the sisters are still alive. Also, Paige realises that she spent too much time in the magic world.
