E4 Extra
Today, January 27
JP and Majita have been engaged for a year, but JP has just finished university and is completely skint and still living at home with his parents. The couple are given Â£12,000 towards their big day, but the catch is that every single decision between must be made by JP alone and Majita must know absolutely nothing until the big day.
