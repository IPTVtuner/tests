Juan from Brighton met Alice 14 months ago and it was love at first sight during a night out in London. Alice is from Plymouth but moved to Brighton to be with Juan, kissing goodbye to her fashion career and friends and taking a job as an estate agent to pay the bills. Alice gave up a lot to be with Juan, but it was worth it. Now Juan is going to repay some of her sacrifice.
