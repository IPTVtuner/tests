E4 Extra
Today, September 16
With a baby to provide for and thousands of pounds of debt, Paul and Emily have had to put their wedding plans on hold twice. They are given Â£12,000 towards the wedding, but have agreed in the presence of a lawyer that Paul will organise it alone, with no contact between them. Will Paul's desire to take charge get out of control or can he give Emily a day she'll never forget?
