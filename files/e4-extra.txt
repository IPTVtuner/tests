Barney's dad Jerome shows up at his home. After learning his father is a driving instructor in the suburbs, Barney decides he's not the cool dad he'd hoped for and wants nothing more to do with him. The gang convinces Barney to give Jerome another chance and take up his offer to have dinner with his wife and son. When he does, Barney finds that he is more upset by Jerome's traditional family life than he expected.
