E4 Extra
Today, December 21
The venue for the fourth programme is La Riviera, a fine dining restaurant in Inverness. Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing Â£8,000 a week to run, the place boasts top French chef Loic Lefebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff with Michelin star-studded backgrounds. Loic is on a mission to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars.
