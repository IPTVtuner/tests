When Mum finds out that Dad didn't throw away his old boxes of science magazines in their clear-out, she goes mad. So Dad builds a bonfire and promises he'll burn them all, but Dad is only pretending to burn them, instead squirrelling the boxes off to his shed in the garden. Mum is excited as her best friend, Val is popping around with her new dress for her daughter Karen's wedding.
