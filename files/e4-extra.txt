Barney is banned from playing Laser quest. Ted tells him he's too old to play the game anyway and Barney discovers that Ted has been writing a list - the Murtaugh list, in honour of the `Lethal Weapon' character Robert Murtaugh - which states the things the gang are too old to do. Barney sets out to prove Ted wrong and performs every entry on the list.
