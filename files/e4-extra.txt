Wayne and Leanne are mad about each other, with the latter dreaming of a fairytale wedding. However, fairytales aren't cheap and their two kids are a priority. The couple are given Â£12,000 towards their big day, but there is one big catch - in the presence of a lawyer, Leanne has agreed to let Wayne organise the wedding all by himself. She won't know a single thing about it until the big day.
