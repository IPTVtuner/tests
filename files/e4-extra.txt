Gordon travels to Ventura Harbor in Southern California to help a family-run Greek restaurant facing big problems that hasn't taken a profit for two years. Makis Mikelatos and his wife Lynn have run the restaurant, the Greek at the Harbor, for 17 years, but Makis - who works 17 hours a day, seven days a week, and rarely takes a holiday - is exhausted, and if he doesn't slow down he's in danger of collapse.
