E4 Extra
Today, January 10
Phoebe realises that she must move on with her life and signs a lease for a new apartment, while Paige considers moving in with Henry, and Piper tries to maintain control after losing Leo. However, the Charmed Ones are forced to stay under the same roof - literally - when a demon kidnaps the sisters, shrinks them and imprisons them in a dollhouse replica of the Manor.
