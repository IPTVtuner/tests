Holiday park entertainments manager Mathew is trying to put on the perfect wedding for his dancer bride Jamie-Lee. But big kid Mathew is planning a swashbuckling pirate adventure, while all his bride-to-be wants is a traditional, grown-up wedding where she can take centre stage for just one day. But with the wind and tides threatening to run his pirate plans aground, and a best man not totally on-board with his ideas, will this loose cannon make it to port? Or will Mathew have to walk the plank?
