Elsewhere, Jimmy visits the meerkats at the wildlife park and demonstrates how they use a puzzle box to feed them to keep their minds active before Jenny keeps our hosts busy with a quick quiz of her own - Shivi is also lending a hand at the wildlife park this time and getting to know the excitable lemurs there before serving up a thin mint with Madagascan vanilla cocktail, and the last dish on the menu is a warming and comforting spiced orange slow-cooked stew served with baked sweet potatoes.
