Tired of being lumped with petty crimes, DI Riya Ajunwa begins to draw connections between an apparently solved missing persons case, a mysteriously obliterated stag, and eco protestors at a fracking site - as trouble brews at the local bread factory, Katie has a frightening encounter in the forest when a monster from the past rears its head in the form of her father, whom Riya arrested for committing a violent crime five years ago and has been released from prison early.
