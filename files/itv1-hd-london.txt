ITV1 London HD
Today, October 13
No adventure around the UK would be complete without a trip to the capital city, London. James is checking out some of his old haunts and stopping in on Clare Smyth's brand new restaurant Core for a bite to eat and a catch up with the world's best female chef. Then high up on the rooftops of London, he cooks up spiced pigeon breast with dhal. Next, James ventures into south east London to a knife forgery in Peckham. He gets hands on in the process of making Japanese style knives.
