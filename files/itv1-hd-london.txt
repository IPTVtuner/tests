Gino and Fred start their journey in the Zillertal Alps in western Austria surrounded by beautiful but tragically melting glaciers - despite Austrian beef being some of the most sustainable in the world, one of the biggest factors of climate change is the production of meat. In their quest to find alternatives, Gino and Fred start with vegetarianism and end with some innovative culinary options in the Austrian capital of Vienna.
