James and Paul are having a blast in Northern Ireland and they've reached Paul's home town of Belfast, where he's giving James a personal tour of Northern Ireland's capital city before they head off for a spot of golf. James pitches up his mobile kitchen right on the green to whip up a tasty dish with bacon, scallops and apples with onion rings. After all his exertion on the golf course, Paul heads just out of town to Carnbrooke Meats.
