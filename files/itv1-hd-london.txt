The tour kicks off in France.John's in charge of the Itinerary and he's booked the team into a self-catering hotel in the quiet medieval town of Provins. Harry wants the lads to be on a detox and cook their own healthy food, but they don't even get through the first night without hitting the beers and ending up at the curry house. Harry's determined to get the boys back in shape for the grudge match against Germany, so he's organised a big game in France against FC Metz.
