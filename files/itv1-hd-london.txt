James' adventure brings him over the border into North Wales, where he's joined by chef Stephen Terry for this leg of his journey. Their first stop is the grand Pale Hall, where head chef Gareth Stevenson is cooking up a real treat - Moroccan-inspired Welsh lamb. James offers his own variation of Welsh lamb in the grounds of the hall, serving with gnocchi and vegetables. Next, one of James' boyhood dreams comes true as he has the ultimate falconry experience.
