Today, November 03
Joining Alan this time are Sarah Parish and Ian McNeice to provide the chat - we also celebrate everything that is great about the Greyface Dartmoor sheep, horticulturalist Camilla-Bassett Smith plants borders at the Manor Farm greenhouse, we catch up with badger cubs as they are released back into the wild, and Bonfire Night comes early with Marverine Coles' fiery beers, ales and stouts.
