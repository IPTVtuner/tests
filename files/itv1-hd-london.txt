Lee Mack hosts a festive special with all the Christmas bells and whistles you would expect - every question is Christmas-themed and our 100 contestants are hoping to make the holiday season even more special by winning up to 100,000 pounds. This Christmas Special is not about what you learned at school or your ability to memorise facts - it's about real intelligence as everyone is on a level playing field.
