Alison meets the most unlikely stray to be wandering the London streets in the form of a rare Romanian Mioritic Shepherd who has a fear of stairs and doorways. As Alison also helps a tiny Bichon control her bark, there is organised chaos when a van with seven Belgian shepherd cross puppies arrives from the RSPCA.
