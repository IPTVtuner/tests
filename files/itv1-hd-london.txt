A documentary about an international investigation into the Rajneesh movement, one of the world's biggest and most successful cults that had communes in more than 30 countries in the 1970s and 1980s. A central truth about the organisation has remained hidden until now - part-retrospective and part-unfolding investigation, this film tells the barely believable story of the treatment of children within the cult.
