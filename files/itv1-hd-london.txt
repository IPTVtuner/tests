Ed Chamberlin presents coverage of five races on the second day of the 2024 Grand National meeting at Aintree - the highlights of the day include the Marsh Chase, which has been won by some superstars in recent years over the specialist trip of two-and-a-half miles, and the professional jockeys in action over the Grand National fences in the Topham Chase. Analysis comes from Sir AP McCoy, Ruby Walsh and Mick Fitzgerald.
