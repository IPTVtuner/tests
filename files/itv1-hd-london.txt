Steve Rider presents coverage of the second round of the 2024 British Touring Car Championship from Brands Hatch with former champion Tom Ingram leading the standings - after a dramatic opening round which saw racing delayed by three hours due to heavy rain, it was Team Bristol Street Motors' Ingram who finished the day the happiest as he won Race One and Race Two after battles with rivals Ash Sutton and Jake Hill and fought his way to a fourth-placed finish in the reverse grid race.
