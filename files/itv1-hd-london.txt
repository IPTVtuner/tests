Michelin-starred chef Jason Atherton uses beautiful produce from the Middle East to create delicious dishes that have fruit as its hero ingredient, including figs with balsamic and honey and a salad of orange, carrot and avocado with a zesty orange and lime dressing. Jason's guest chef this time is Daniel Birk - his own executive chef in Dubai - who samples some fruity cocktails before creating a delicious lobster and mango dish.
