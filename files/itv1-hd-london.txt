Ainsley is feeling fruity! In this episode, all his dishes use fruit - he begins with a dish from his travels, Rose Harissa Chicken Tagine with Apricots and Chickpeas. On the road, he pays a visit to Willy Chase to find out about his Apple Cider Vinegar and the magic of his orchards. On the beach, Ainsley fires up the BBQ to make Chargrilled Chicken and Pineapple Chow Skewers with Coconut Slaw, using a dash of Willy's vinegar to add a delicious tang.
