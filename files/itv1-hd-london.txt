A bungling bachelor becomes a last-minute babysitter. Buck's brother's three children are foisted on him when the parents are called away from home indefinitely. Although he seems to be an unsuitable guardian, Buck turns out to have an unexpected knack for parenting, but he must work hard to prove himself, especially when he needs to save his eldest niece from her unsavoury boyfriend.
