Alan Titchmarsh makes over a garden in Newark for double amputee veteran Nathan Cumberland and his young family. Despite his injuries, Nathan has devoted his life outside the armed forces to supporting older and elderly veterans who are often less likely to seek help for themselves. With lots of tips on how to create a beautiful woodland themed outdoor space, Alan and his team of experts take on Nathan's inaccessible plot and transform it into a show-stopping family garden.
