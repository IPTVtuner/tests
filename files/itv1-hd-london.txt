Gabriel Clarke presents a look back at a memorable year for Irish rugby as Joe Schmidt's side secured a much coveted Six Nations Grand Slam - only the third in Irish history. Johnny Sexton set the tone in the opening match in Paris against France with a breath-taking 45-metre drop goal deep into injury time to secure a dramatic 15-13 win, and it was all rounded off fittingly on St Patrick's Day at Twickenham with an emphatic victory against England.
