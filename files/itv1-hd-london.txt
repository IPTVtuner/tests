Chinese thief Passepartout needs a getaway, and boffin Phileas Fogg needs a companion to help him win a globetrotting wager. They are joined by Monique La Roche, the beautiful French artist, and together they race the globe. Unfortunately, they also seemed to be trailed by Inspector Fix, who thinks Fogg committed a major bank robbery.
