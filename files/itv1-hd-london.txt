Jimmy Akingbola hosts the classic panel show with a twist - this time Nabil Abdulrashid, Paul Chowdhry, Adjani Salmon and Sarah Keyworth join team leaders Chizzy Akudolu and Eddie Kadi to take viewers on a tour of Black British history. Insightful, educational, bold, tongue-in-cheek and above all very funny, the teams do battle over four rounds - it's history with a touch of colour.
