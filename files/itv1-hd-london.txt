It's the winter of 2019, and the airport is having its busiest year to date. They're expecting more than 81 million passengers to fly in and out of the UK's favourite gateway, with its 76,000 staff ready to take on whatever is thrown at them, and they do it all with a smile on their face. This is Heathrow before lockdown, where the Aviation Police are on the front line to protect Heathrow. Officers Terry and Dave return.
