We explore the magic and mystery of the Islands and highlands of Scotland. Julia Bradbury hikes the West Highland Way, while Robson Green attempts to dive for scallops off the Isle of Skye. At the historic Edinburgh castle, local boy Rory Bremner finds an unusual way to set his watch, and in the waters around the Isle of Mull, Liz Bonnin gets up close with some rare sea creatures.
