David Dickinson is in Bradford in West Yorkshire helping sellers to get the real deal for their antiques and valuables - however, some dealers are happier than others this time as Alison Chapman is tempted to keep a lovely aquamarine and diamond ring for herself, Karen Dalmeny is quietly cringing at what's on her table, and Tracy Thackray Howitt is doubly happy with something which both ticks and is made of gold.
