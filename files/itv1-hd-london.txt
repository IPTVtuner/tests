David Dickinson is in Stoke in Staffordshire to help sellers to get the real deal for their antiques and valuables - this show sees a bargain ceramic cat bought in a charity shop just a few days earlier have buyers queuing up at auction to deliver a 'purrfect' profit, Mark Stevens find the offer of an Italian meal from a smart seller just too good to refuse, and the Dealers spend thousands of pounds of their own money to try to make a profit.
