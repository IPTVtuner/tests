Alan and his team are in Salford to create an eco-inspired kitchen garden, for a community hero who likes to feed everyone and is passionate about recycling. Alan, Frances Tophill and Katie Rushworth recycle, re-use and go green to create a quaint, mix and match garden that's designed to provide a bounty of flowers and food. Meanwhile, David Domoney is tasked with creating an edible and floral delight on the tiny deck next to a moored-up narrowboat, inspired by the boat owners' travelling life.
