James Martin is at home in the Hampshire countryside and serving up some of his favourite-ever recipes from previous series of his Saturday Morning show - in this episode, James makes satay sauce using peanut butter from Cornwall, chef Lisa Goodwin-Allen treats James and Phil Howard to a panna cotta, and James gives us a Masterclass in the right way to cook pork shops and also serves up a plate of salt and pepper squid and prawns for comedian Joe Pasquale.
