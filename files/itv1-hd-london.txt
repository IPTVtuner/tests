James and Stephen head south through Wales en route to Pembrokeshire. But before they get there, they stop to visit Gareth Ward and his stunning restaurant Ynyshir. After filling their bellies, they make it to the coast where James cooks up his Marloes Sands seafood parcel. Stephen tracks down Wales' answer to Willy Wonka, young chocolatier Liam Burgess, who helps him make a very special one-off-chocolate bar for James.
