Mr Bean has somehow managed to get a job as a security guard. His latest assignment finds him travelling to America as an art expert, looking after the famous `Whistler's Mother' painting as it is transported from Britain to a posh new Los Angeles museum. The catch is that Bean is no art expert and his trip was a ploy by his British employers to get rid of him. Unfortunately, no one has warned the Americans about Mr Bean.
