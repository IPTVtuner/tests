ITV's UK Editor Paul Brand interviews Prime Minister Rishi Sunak about whether he has the plan and personality to win or if he is leading the Tories to their worst defeat in decades. As Mr Sunak takes his case to the voters, we explore his life, his politics and his policies speaking to those who know him best, those who witnessed his rapid rise to power, and those who could be with him at the heart of government if he extends the Conservatives' 14-year reign.
