Francesca Cumani and Ed Chamberlin present coverage of racing from Newmarket, Salisbury and Hamilton - the feature meeting of the day is at Newmarket, where it's the turn of the fillies to take centre stage as they line up in the 2025 1,000 Guineas, and there is also competitive racing on the undercard alongside action from Salisbury and Hamilton. Analysis comes from Jason Weaver, reporting from Matt Chapman and Oli Bell, and commentary from Richard Hoiles.
