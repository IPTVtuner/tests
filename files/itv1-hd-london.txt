James Martin is at home in the Hampshire countryside and serving up some of his favourite-ever recipes from previous series of his Saturday Morning show - in this episode, James cooks a delicious dish of lamb from the salt marshes of Wales and learns how to make Richard Bertinet's magic puff balls. James also gives us a Masterclass in the right way to make our own custard, and he serves some classic French cuisine for his guest Lisa Snowdon and chefs Claude Bosi and Jonny Lake as well.
