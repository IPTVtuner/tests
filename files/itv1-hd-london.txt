This year is Heathrow's 75th birthday and as it continues to get back on its feet the time has come to open up the last of its closed terminals - Terminal 4. But it's not open for everyone - it is exclusively for passengers arriving from red list countries, and at the helm is passenger experience manager Numan. Out on the airfield, Inspector Shard and Sergeant Dawson receive word of a man who is wandering around the apron, sparking a cross-terminal man hunt.
