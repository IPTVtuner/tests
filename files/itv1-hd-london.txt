It's a case of old friends reunited in Lyon as Wales face Australia and Warren Gatland and Eddie Jones lock horns once again - after a tough year for Welsh rugby, Gatland's return to the fold in what is his fifth World Cup campaign looks to have steadied the ship, and the dramatic opening win over Fiji will have filled his team with confidence.
