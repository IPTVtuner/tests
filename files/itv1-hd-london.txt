Ainsley starts his `Forgotten Classics' menu with a sumptuous minced beef, potato and onion pie served with buttery greens. TV presenter and radio DJ Vick Hope joins Ainsley to introduce him to a spicy prawn cocktail and a rumba round the kitchen, and long-time friend Brian Turner will be reminding us why faggots deserve a come-back. Finally, Ainsley puts a fresh spin on the coronation chicken.
