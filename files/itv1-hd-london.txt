Raymond dedicates this episode to his favourite tipple - wine. He cooks a simple braised beef in red wine and is joined by chef Michael Caines who cooks a pan-fried turbot with roasted leeks, red wine sauce and parsley oil. Raymond also visits a local winery - Hundred Hills Vineyard - to prove you don't have to travel internationally for the best wine, it's right here on our doorstep in the heart of the English countryside.
