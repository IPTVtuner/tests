John and Lisa are feeling nostalgic and looking back on some of their favourite recipes from their Christmas Kitchen over the years. There's everything from breakfast to sweet treats and from festive drinks to delicious ways to use up your leftovers. They begin with a savoury croissant bake that's guaranteed to start the big day with a bang, then the ideal treat for gifting - salted chocolate truffles - that's washed down with John's eggnog.
