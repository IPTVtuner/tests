David Flatman presents coverage of the 2023 Rugby World Cup as Scotland take on Tonga at the Stade de Nice - these two sides have only faced each other once before at the tournament back in 1995 when Scotland won 41-5 in Pretoria, and Gregor Townsend's side will be eager to register their first win of the pool stages after losing their opening game 18-3 against defending world champions South Africa.
