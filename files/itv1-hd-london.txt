The concluding part of a two-part documentary series. Detectives raid Luke D'Wit's home and seize a huge stash of prescription drugs - including fentanyl and antihistamine - that are both found in the Baxters' postmortem as police press Luke to explain his relationship to Carol Baxter's mysterious American physician Dr Andrea Bowden. Luke has been mixing 'medicinal' drinks for Carol on Dr Bowden's instructions, but detectives can find no trace of her existence.
