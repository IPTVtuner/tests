Ainsley is inspired by the great dishes of the school canteen, and starts his school dinner menu with a sumptuous shepherd's pie with minted peas. Pussycat Doll Kimberly Wyatt joins Ainsley, and introduces him to her American school canteen favourite: a cheese and bean tortilla. Baking queen Juliet Sear puts a spin on a classic school-time dessert with her cornflake tart, and Ainsley revs up the comforting school dinner classic of mac and cheese with bacon and leeks.
