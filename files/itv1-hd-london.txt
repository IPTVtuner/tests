The emergency nurses of Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital take you behind the curtains of East Anglia's busiest A and E department in this documentary series to prove that passion, care and a good sense of humour are crucial to working in one - in this episode, emergency nurses Jess, Hayley and Connor treat two bizarre injuries, Charlie and Gerry race to stabilise a RTC victim, and Toni treats a teen whose bike stunt ended in a painful disaster.
