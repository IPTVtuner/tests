Alan Titchmarsh heads to Birmingham to surprise Georgie Moseley - the founder of Britain's first cancer drop-in centre. Dedicated to her son Harry, who she sadly lost to brain cancer when he was just 11, the Drop In Centre provides support to families coping with a cancer diagnosis. At Georgie's home, inspired by where the Moseley family spent their final holiday together with Harry, the team transforms her grim backyard into an Ibizan-style hideaway full of happy reminders of Harry.
