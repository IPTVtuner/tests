The fourth round of the 2023-24 FA Cup pits West Bromwich Albion against Wolverhampton Wanderers - with just 11 miles separating these two clubs, this match is known as the Black Country derby. These two clubs have played over 150 times, and although Wolves are now in the Premier League and West Brom are in the Championship, this will be only the third time in 12 years that they have met.
