2020 winners Exeter Chiefs have made a superb start to their 2023-24 Champions Cup campaign - after a last-gasp Henry Slade conversion secured a dramatic 19-18 win in Toulon. Meanwhile, Glasgow have bounced back after a disappointing home defeat by Northampton on the opening weekend with an impressive 12-11 away to Bayonne in Round Two, and their ranks won't be short on quality with Scotland stars Huw Jones, Sione Tuipulotu, Kyle Steyn and Matt Fagerson in them.
