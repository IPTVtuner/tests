In this opening episode, Paul first travels to the jungle surrounding Chiang Mai in northern Thailand, an area home to over half the country's 3,500 domesticated elephants - it's also home to Thailand's largest elephant sanctuary in the form of the Elephant Nature Park run by world-renowned conservationist Lek Chailert, who has rescued hundreds of elephants from a hard life's graft in the logging and tourism industries.
