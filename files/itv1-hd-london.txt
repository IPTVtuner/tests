Ed Chamberlin presents racing from Ascot and Haydock - the feature meeting of the day is at Ascot, where the Clarence House Chase is the highlight on a superb card and will feature some of the top two-mile chasers in the country in action. There are also plenty of top-class performers on show at Haydock with trials for some of the Cheltenham races taking place that include the Champion Hurdle trial.
