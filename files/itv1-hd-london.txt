Mark Pougatch is joined by Roy Keane, Ian Wright, and Gaizka Mendieta for coverage as two of the form teams in the tournament - Germany and Spain - meet in Stuttgart in a repeat of the final from 2008. The hosts edged past Denmark in a nervy Round of 16 match. The impressive Spanish made serene progress to the last eight by comfortably seeing off Georgia 4-1 with winger Nico Williams again catching the eye with a superb finish - match commentary comes from Sam Matterface and Ally McCoist.
