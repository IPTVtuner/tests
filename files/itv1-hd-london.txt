A blooper special presented by Bradley Walsh and featuring The Governess, The Sinnerman, The Beast, The Vixen, The Dark Destroyer and The Menace - you might think they're all perfect and never make mistakes, but you would be wrong. Luckily, Brad and the Chasers are happy to share some clips we were never meant to see along with some other clips they didn't want us to see.
