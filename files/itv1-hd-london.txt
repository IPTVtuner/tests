James continues his British adventure in Lancashire with top local chef Lisa Allen in the passenger seat of his trusty red mini. Their first stop is an incredible food hall in Lisa's home town of Clitheroe. Here they shop and then cook together a fantastic BBQ'd john dory with kohlrabi and fennel salad. Next, Lisa is in the driving seat as she takes the mini to a local buffalo farm where they're producing some interesting cheese from buffalo milk.
