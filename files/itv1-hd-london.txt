Joining Alan at Manor Farm this time are Sir Cameron McKintosh, Annette Badland, and the youngest of The Durrells' clan in the form of actor Milo Parker - Miranda's mum Dee Hart-Dyke takes us around her impressive garden, we have ten very excitable spaniels, horticulturalist Camilla Bassett-Smith opens up the pages of her December diary, and there are some very sticky liqueurs in the Best of British feature.
