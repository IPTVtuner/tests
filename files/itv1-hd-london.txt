Ainsley indulges his naughty side with all kinds of sweets and treats, starting with his cheesy, gooey souffle Welsh rarebit muffins. Bake Off star Briony Williams wows with her towering treat, a miso caramel and pear chocolate layer cake. Superstar, actor, singer and legend John Barrowman entertains, whilst Ainsley shows him how to make the French classic palmiers two ways - savoury and sweet.
