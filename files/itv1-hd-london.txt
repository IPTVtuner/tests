Stephen Mulhern presents the pop-up gameshow based on the original Saturday Night Takeaway feature. Our host takes their unique brand of games and quizzes to the streets, challenging unsuspecting members of the public for a chance to win anything from the price of their petrol to a sizeable cash prize. No imposing studio, no tense music, no risking it all - this is all about fantastic characters, crazy games, and the perfect dose of fun!
