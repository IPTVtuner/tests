Ed Chamberlin presents coverage of racing from Ascot and Haydock - the feature meeting of the day is the card at Ascot where the Grade One Clarence House Chase is likely to be one of the highlights of the season where some of the top two-mile chasers are in action, and there is also some excellent supporting action from Haydock too. Analysis comes from Mick Fitzgerald and Tom Scudamore, reporting from Alice Plunkett, Sally Ann Grassick and Matt Chapman, and commentary from Richard Hoiles.
