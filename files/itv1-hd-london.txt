Following in the footsteps of the ITV drama, Susanna Reid interviews senior officers from Operation Minstead to tell the real story of the 17-year hunt for the serial rapist known as 'The Night Stalker' and the 17-day stakeout that led to his eventual arrest. Former SIOs Colin Sutton and Simon Morgan speak candidly about one of the most complex investigations the Met has ever had to face and reflect on the tragic mistake that meant he could have been stopped years earlier.
