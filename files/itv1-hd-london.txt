There's a big crowd awaiting David Dickinson and his team at Fleetwood in Lancashire and there are plenty of dilemmas for sellers and dealers - Stewart Hofgartner is not sure what to do with a papier mache nodding dog, we see why a set of Marvel comics is one man's dream collection but his wife's nightmare, Jan Keyne discovers what whisky noggins are, and a table full of gold could be about to pay for a dream cruise.
