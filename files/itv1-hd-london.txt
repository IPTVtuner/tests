Ireland have made a strong start to their Six Nations title defence - after their impressive opening weekend win in Marseille, they eased to a comfortable 36-0 victory in Dublin against Italy with new talent including Jack Crowley, Joe McCarthy and Calvin Nash catching the eye. By contrast, Wales have suffered two narrow defeats - firstly against Scotland, when they fell just short after mounting a stirring second-half comeback - and then in a 16-14 loss to England at Twickenham.
