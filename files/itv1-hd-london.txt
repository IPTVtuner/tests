Mr Bean is going on holiday to the south of France, looking for a quiet and sunny trip in the Riviera. However, his trip doesn't go as smoothly as he expected when he has to face a series of misunderstandings and totally unfortunate coincidences. Eventually, Mr Bean will end up spoiling the last film of the snobbish director Carson Clay and appearing by accident at the Cannes Film Festival.
