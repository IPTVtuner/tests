David Flatman presents coverage of South Africa's second match at the 2023 Rugby World Cup as they take on Romania in Bordeaux - these two sides have only ever met once before at the Rugby World Cup, and that was back in 1995 when South Africa were the tournament hosts. The Springboks beat Romania 21-8 during the pool stages in Cape Town and the world champions will be eager to claim another victory with Tonga and 2023 Six Nations Grand Slam winners Ireland still to play in Pool B.
