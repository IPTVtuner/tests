It's Small's birthday. Tiny is planning to put on a special show for him, which involves using her scooter and calling on help from the froglets and the singing flowers. But her scooter has developed a squeak. She calls on Major to help her mend it, but when Small accidentally overhears them talking about a scooter, he thinks that must be what he is getting for his present and he's very pleased. But what he ends up with is not quite what he expected - and much more exciting.
