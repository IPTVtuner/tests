Meagaidh the Border Collie is a search and rescue dog who works with her owner Tom. Her supernose follows scents and smells like clues, so they can rescue people who need their help. Meagaidh and Tom are visiting a school to show the children how a search and rescue dog works. They demonstrate some of their equipment, including Meagaidh's special doggy goggles, which she wears to keep the wind and dust out of her eyes when she's in the helicopter.
