Kika is a golden Labrador and a guide dog for her owner, Dr Amit, who is blind, which means he cannot see. She is trained to use her supersight to help Dr Amit do as many things as he can by himself. Together, they make the best team! Dr Amit and Kika have an important mission to pick up a surprise cake and some party hats from the supermarket for Aunty Nina's birthday.
