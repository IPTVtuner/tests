Yakka Dee! celebrates children communicating - because talking fills you up with whizz, pop, bang! In this episode, Dee encourages a friend to say 'cup' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. We see lots of different cups and explore how they look and what they do. We see a pink cup, a sippy cup and even a drippy cup full of Dee's paint! We enjoy a flower cup, a flutter cup and a cute little cup full of bubbles.
