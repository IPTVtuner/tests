Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the tub of blue slimy stuff and remembers the day she got it. Caitlin is in her new den, but she's in a bit of a grump and doesn't want to share it with anyone. When Euan, Ruby and Ayesha try to get in, she becomes an even bigger grump. Ruby has dropped a book about monsters and this gives Caitlin an idea - she's going to pretend her den has a monster to scare the others away!
