Everyone is excited about competing in Snowy Sports Day. Competing are Bitz, Queen of Speed, Bevel the Blaze, Pacey Purl, Robo-Blast Bob, Pop the Snow Pro and Zip the One-Throw Wonder. Pacey Purl really wants to win to finally get her name on the champion's cup. But to know who's won, they need to find a way of keeping track of the scores. They try counting on their fingers, but they're too wiggly. They could use snowballs, but they're too much fun to play with.
