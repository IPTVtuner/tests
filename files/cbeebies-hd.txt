The Squirrels notice that Happy looks and seems different - he is frowning, his smile is upside down, and he's wearing new trainers! When they check in on him, Happy is frustrated, but he can't seem to identify where his frustration is coming from. They turn to Duggee for help, who uses his feeling cards to explain an array of feelings to Happy. All the Squirrels help by relaying their past experiences and the feelings that they evoked.
