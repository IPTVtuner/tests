Maddie uses a special thermal imaging camera to find out how the hot water system in a house works and then visits a reservoir to see where the water comes from and how it is sent to our homes. Next, Maddie visits a toothpaste factory to see how toothpaste is made from different ingredients and uses a special slow motion camera to find out how the stripes get inside a tube of stripy toothpaste.
