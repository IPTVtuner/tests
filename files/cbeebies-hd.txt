Bing and Pando experiment with Bing's toy train on the Fun Fort in the playground. The train is good at going over bridges and brilliant at going down the slide. But when Bing slides it off the roof of the playhouse, the train crashes and breaks. Bing is upset until he realises that the pieces fit together to make something completely different.
