Maddie finds out about things you might have in your home. She visits a lamp workshop to discover how a lamp lets us see in the dark. She learns that inside a light switch is an electrical contact that lets electricity flow around a lamp, letting it switch on and off. She uses her special proscope camera to see the tiny holes that make up a lampshade, which allow light from the lightbulb to come out. Next, Maddie visits a playhouse factory to learn how a playhouse is made.
