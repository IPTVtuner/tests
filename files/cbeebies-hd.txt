Maddie does the recycling. She uses a special camera to find out how a bin lorry works to lift a bin and tip the rubbish into the hopper. An animation reveals how a moving wall inside the lorry crushes the rubbish to make way for more. Next, Maddie visits a recycling plant to see how the rubbish is sorted. She then visits a paper mill to see how the old paper is recycled into newspapers.
