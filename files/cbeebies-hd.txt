Mrs Goggins has organised a fun sculpture trail, and lots of people, including the children, have been busy making their own sculptures to add to the display. PC Selby has made a giant policeman's helmet, Alf has made a straw tractor, and Reverend Timms has even made a giant angel! The trouble is that naughty Rosie the goat has nibbled bits on all the pieces.
