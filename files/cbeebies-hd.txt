Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how butterflies and moths play an important role in the environment. They find out that they are fantastic pollinators who help to create habitats for other creatures to live. They learn how their poo can return nutrients to the soil and how butterflies and moths can be food for other animals too. On the way, they get up close to a dragonfly and turn into Rambler butterflies!
