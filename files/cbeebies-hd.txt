Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the tinkly bell and remembers the day she got it. Alice has organised a relaxation class but is worried that no-one will come. Molly tries to persuade all the people at the Hub to come to the class. Mack, Daisy, James and the kids join the class, but Moira says she has lots of jobs to do before a council inspection later that day.
