Today, February 15
With a puff of smoke, Wizard Tripwick magically appears and bumbles his way into his classroom. Inside he opens his dusty old spellbook and attempts to teach his pupils a spell to make a glass of water disappear. But when he casts the spell, two wizarding pupils disappear instead. Meanwhile, Enrico Paso Doble and his dance partner perform an Irish Jig, but Enrico keeps getting distracted trying to play a game of football.
