After playing air hockey at home, Georgia decides with her mum that she would like to learn how to ice skate. They both head over to the ice rink, where they have their very first lesson and learn how to stay steady on their feet. They decide to learn more about ice skating by going to watch an ice hockey match, where the players are very skilled at skating. They head over to try a spot of rollerblading to help practise their balance, before finishing the day with a second ice skating lesson.
