Diesel is a hearing dog for his teenage owner, Rayane, who is deaf. This means he doesn't hear everything. Diesel is trained to listen out for important sounds that Rayane might miss. Diesel is Rayane's ears. Together, they're unstoppable! Rayane needs Diesel's help to do his Sunday chores. But first, Rayane teaches Diesel a new command - 'find it'. When Rayane squeaks his squeaker and makes the sign, Diesel has to find it. Diesel loves learning new commands!
