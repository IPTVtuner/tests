It's fashion show time. Bitz has designed some fantastic hats, Bob is taking the photographs, Purl is modelling them and Bevel is guiding them through the jungle to find the perfect place to hold the show. But when they arrive, they discover the hats have been taken by two cheeky hat-loving monkeys who keep running away. Bitz needs to work out how they can creep up on the monkeys without being seen and get the hats back in time to hold the fashion show.
