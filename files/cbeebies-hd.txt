Doctor Gilbertson has a visitor arriving in the afternoon - her sister's cat, Bess! Bess looks rather similar to Jess. Pat and Julian have promised to get Bess to Doctor Gilbertson. It seems to Jess that Julian likes Bess more than him! When Bess escapes, it makes Julian realise how much he loves his good old friend Jess after all.
