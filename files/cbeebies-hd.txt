Dee encourages a friend to say `bird' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. We see lots of different birds, from small birds to big birds, flying birds to swimming birds. There's a pecking bird, a magnificent bird, a napping bird and even a rapping bird! Look out for the feathery bird, the flying bird and also some little tweeting birds in a nest.
