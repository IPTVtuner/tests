Bing and Pando discover a new climbing frame at the playground. It has climbing bits, tippy bits and even a wobbly bridge. But when Bing gets to the top of the slide it's too scary for him to go down. Bing watches Pando to see how he does it, then he helps Hoppity Voosh to go down. When Hoppity likes it, Bing has a go too.
