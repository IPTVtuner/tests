When the farmer and her daughter plant their last wrinkly seed, they don't have great expectations of a successful crop. But to their amazement, the seed grows into the most enormous turnip! It's so big that they need help from some passing animals to pull it up. Musicians from the BBC Philharmonic are joined by trumpeter Sean Chandler to share a musical retelling of this classic comedy tale.
