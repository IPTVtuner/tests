Bella and Laila are taking a particular interest in what Mali's mum, Ameera, is up to. Zainab reveals that Ameera is nervous about a job interview and when Sam learns that Flo is recruiting at the café, Bella comes to the `obvious' conclusion that Ameera is planning on working at the café. Bella is determined that the Apple Tree kids should help Ameera get that job even though it transpires that Ameera's not that good at making tea.
