Today, Gabriel is making a famous dish from Cornwall that his mum has taught him. Cornish pasties are a traditional lunchtime meal where meat, vegetables or both are wrapped in a pastry case. Gabriel is using the vegetable swede, but his friends don't like the taste of it on its own. Hopefully they'll prefer it when they taste it in the finished pasties. Gabriel shows us a really clever way to crimp the pastry case and serves the pasties to his friends in a traditional way.
