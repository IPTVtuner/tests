Iaia is cooking for us today and he is making a delicious stew from Guinea-Bissau called Kansiye. The dish is made with lentils, although not all of his friends are sure about the taste and smell of them when they try them before the meal. Let's hope Iaia's cooked recipe, served with rice and carrots, changes their minds. Before serving, Iaia puts a vase of olive branches on his table, as these are a symbol of Guinea-Bissau.
