Bitz is excited to be serving her yummy Bitz mix marmalade to lots of hungry customers at the Jungle Cafe, and things get even better when top chef Madame Gourmet unexpectedly arrives. If she likes the marmalade, she might put the recipe in her new cookbook. The only problem is that with Zip and Pop as waiters, no-one seems to be getting any food. Bitz has to figure out how to get the food from the kitchen to the tables without Zip and Pop eating it.
