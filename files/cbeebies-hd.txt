Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the little watering can and remembers the day she got it. Molly and the other kids are making paper flowers at the Kids Club while Bob places a display of real flowers in an ornamental wheelbarrow outside the Big Hub. Meanwhile, Mrs Juniper is selling flower-themed cakes and has ordered a display of flowers for her counter.
