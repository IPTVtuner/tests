Hearing dog Diesel is off to the beach with his owner Rayane so he can try out the new metal detector he got for his birthday. Rayane is deaf, which means he doesn't hear everything, and Diesel's super ears are trained to alert him to important sounds he might miss. Diesel is Rayane's ears! Rayane and Diesel have been practising with the metal detector in the garden.
