Newfoundland Sylvie is a big therapy dog who loves to help people when they are worried with big soft cuddles. She and her owner Katrina visit all sorts of people every day, young and old. Sylvie and Katrina are helping a little boy called Alfie who is visiting his great-grandfather 'Pop-Pop' for the first time at the Woofton Care Home - and Alfie's a bit nervous. Pop-Pop has just moved in, so the care home is a new place for everyone. And a new place needs a brave face.
