Maddie visits an indoor water park and uses a special waterproof camera and animation to show how a water slide works. She then goes underneath the swimming pool to see what happens inside the pump room to pump the water to the top of the slide. Next, Maddie visits a factory to see how ice cream cones are made from a type of batter and how special hot plates are used to create the criss-cross waffle pattern.
