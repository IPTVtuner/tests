Pat has a very unusual delivery - an enormous tree which Alf has ordered for Thompson Ground. Pat has strapped it into the four-by-four and is driving very slowly. Jess is worried about the little nest Pat has not noticed in the tree - it's full of baby birds! The children have an archaeological dig in Thompson.
