Bob wants to plant a sign on the top of Mount Robo-Bob, so they set off in grippy shoes to climb it. They meet Ranger Bevel, who tells them about the abominable snow monsters and says he'll guide them up the mountain safely. At the summit, Bob plants his sign, but then the snow monsters appear, causing Ranger Bevel to slip and slide down the mountain uncontrollably. Bitz sees Bob's sign and they all leap on it to give chase, but they can't stop and they overtake Bevel.
