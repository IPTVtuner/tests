Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how lavender plays an important role in the environment. They find out that lavender attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, who love its smell, but that its scent can also help keep garden pests away. On the way, they take some cuttings to help new lavender to grow and find out just how calming the smell of lavender can be for people too.
