Tiny Clanger has made up a lovely new tune to play with her singing flower friends. Mother Clanger thinks Tiny is very talented, but when Tiny suggests Mother should have a go, she gets very flustered and rushes off to her garden. But Major Clanger has a plan - and soon there is the sound of lovely music coming from the garden. Who can possibly be playing?
