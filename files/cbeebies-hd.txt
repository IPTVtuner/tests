Bob, or Big Bad Robo Wolf, showing just how bad he is, locks Ra-Purl-Zel in the castle tower. While Purl is busily knitting, Bitz and Sir Bevel try to engineer a way to rescue her. Sir Bevel tries first but ends up stuck inside the tower alongside Purl. Bitz now has to rescue them both by working out how to get enough balls of yarn up to Ra-Purl-Zel so she can knit an escape ladder.
