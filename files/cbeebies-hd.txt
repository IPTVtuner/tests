Bob can't go to his friend Phoebe's party because she has measles. This puts a stop to his aim to try to beat his previous record of shooting four basketball hoops in a row. Bitz decides to throw the best beach party ever to make up for it. There are snacks, games, a dance floor and even a basketball hoop! But it's a very warm day and soon everyone is too hot to party.
