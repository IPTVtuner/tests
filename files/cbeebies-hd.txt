The Iron Chicken is in her nest singing along to her radio, when suddenly it stops working. Major Clanger is fishing nearby and tries to repair it on the spot but in the end decides he will have to take it to his workshop. The Iron Chicken is distraught but Granny assures her that Major knows what he's doing, and reluctantly the Iron Chicken returns to her nest where she receives a visit from the Wols, who suggest they create their own radio station - Radio Wol. It is a huge success.
