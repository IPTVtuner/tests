Maddie learns about land and water. Maddie visits a port to find out how cars are loaded onto a ferry so they can be carried across the water. She then uses her special cameras to drive onto the ferry, and we see how a special floor called the garage deck is pushed up using a hydraulic ram to make a brand-new floor underneath. Next, Maddie heads to a globe factory to find out how globes are made. She sees how water and land are painted onto flat pieces of paper called gore.
