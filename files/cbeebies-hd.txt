Jen is trying to put together an audio database of animal sounds for Mr Hammond's birthday, but one sound, resembling a howl, eludes them. Andy jets off in his safari-mobile to the Sonoran desert in America in search of the mystery sound and the animal that made it. Along the way, he meets a grasshopper mouse and escapes a pack of hungry harris hawks.
