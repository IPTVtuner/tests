Preschool series celebrating foods from a rich diversity of backgrounds. Larry's family come from China. China is famous for its wonderful food, so Larry's friends are very excited to come over for his Chinese-themed meal. Larry's steamed tofu, egg and prawn recipe is cooked in his mum's special steamer but it can be made in an ordinary oven too. Larry's mum has even made some vegetable fried rice to serve with his dish.
