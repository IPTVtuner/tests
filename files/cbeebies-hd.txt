Major invents a giant magnet. Everything metal flies towards it, from soup tankards to knitting needles. Mother and Granny tell Major to take it outside where it can't do any harm. But then the Iron Chicken lands, and after an unfortunate incident where she gets stuck to the magnet, she tells Major, Tiny and Small about a strange sound she has heard in space. They investigate and find a moon whale trapped in an old metal rocket booster. The magnet turns out to be perfect for the rescue.
