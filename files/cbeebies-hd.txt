Maddie uses special cameras to find out how a digital cat flap works and how a tiny microchip unlocks the cat flap so the cats can go in and out of the house. Next, Maddie visits a sheep farm to see how a fleece is sheared from a sheep. She then goes to a mill to see how the fleece is washed, spun and dyed and turned into wool. The finished wool is then knitted into a woolly hat.
