The Skymoos have collected bits of metal from the Iron Chicken's nest and are building a special nest of their own on the Clangers' planet. The Clangers are intrigued - who can it be for? Tiny decides to decorate it with flowers from Mother's garden, and Granny makes a special blanket for the nest. Soon a large group of Skymoos arrives. All the Clangers go indoors to give the Skymoos some peace. Granny realises something special is about to happen - the birth of a Baby Skymoo.
