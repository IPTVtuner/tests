Maddie uses a special light to see the blood vessels under her skin, and finds out how a blood pressure monitor works to check that blood is flowing freely around our bodies. Maddie then visits the plaster room and shows how a cast is made by having one put on her arm. She uses a special microscope camera to reveal how the fiberglass strands are woven together to make the cast strong.
