Today, September 10
Steve and Aneeshwar meet a hungry giant anteater and feed him his breakfast in a long tube so they can see his superlong nose and tongue. Next, they go to see a group of chimpanzees who are also having breakfast and making lots of noise at the same time! Steve and Aneeshwar find out how these two very different animals have something in common.
