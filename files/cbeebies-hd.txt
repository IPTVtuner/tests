The Greendale Flyer is ready for a trip to the seaside! Julian is excited and he is packing buckets, spades, kites and a picnic ready for the fun day out. Pat and Sarah are all ready to go when an urgent call from Ben stops Pat - Mrs Goggins' handbag is at the sorting office and she is going to need it, especially since it has her train ticket inside it.
