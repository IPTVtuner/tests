As the air grows cold, a crystal-shaped seed lands on the Clangers' planet. Granny helps Tiny to plant it, and it quickly grows into a wonderful crystal tree. Other seeds fall, and soon there is a small forest of them. Mother Clanger has heard that these amazing trees can sparkle and glow, but none of the Clangers know how this is done - until completely by accident, Tiny discovers that music is the answer.
