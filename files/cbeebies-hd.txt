Today, March 10
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the `Very Berry Delights' pot and remembers the day she got it. Bob has a big order from Mrs Juniper for berries, but the birds keep stealing them from his allotment and he's about to run out. Meanwhile, Mrs Juniper is proudly selling her 'Very Berry Delights' in little pots. Moira's too busy to have one as she's having a clearout.
