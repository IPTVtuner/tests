Lola is going to Lotta's house for her first ever sleepover, and it couldn't be more exciting. However, little by little, Lola realises everything is a bit different from her normal bedtime. Lotta brushes her teeth after bath time, not before! Even a midnight feast can't cheer her up. When it's finally time to put the light out, Lola admits that she wants to go home.
