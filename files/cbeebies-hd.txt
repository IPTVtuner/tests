Bing and Sula really enjoy painting a giant mural at Amma's nursery until Bing's enthusiastic rainbow painting makes paint run all over Sula's beautiful tree. Sula is upset, until Flop and Amma help them see that the painting is not spoiled - it is just different. In fact, the harder they look the more they can see that they have painted a beautiful rainbow tree.
