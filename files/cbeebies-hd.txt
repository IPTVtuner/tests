Dr Ranj visits Kiwa on one of the wards, who is going to be having an operation. Kiwa needs to have a naso-gastric tube fitted so the doctors can give her special food and medicine, which is placed up her nose and then down her throat to reach her tummy. Though it feels a bit funny at first, Dr Ranj explains that Kiwa will get used to the tube, and once it's fitted he gives her a special sticker for being so good!
