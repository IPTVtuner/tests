Brunsli Biscuits are a traditional Swiss recipe that taste and smell very Christmassy. Tilly adds spices such as ground nutmeg to her chocolate biscuit dough, before cutting it into snowflake shapes. With the help of her sister, Tilly decorates her biscuits with a beautiful white icing. Tilly's table has lots of Christmas decorations on it as well as the traditional flower of Switzerland, edelweiss. Let's hope Tilly's friends enjoy the taste of the biscuits!
