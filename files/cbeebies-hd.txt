Dorothy is looking forward to a delivery from Pat - a hive of brand-new honey bees! Pat has all the gear for handling bees, but keeping swarming bees in a hive is a tricky business! As the bees escape and start to buzz all over Greendale it's up to Pat to chase and gather them all up again so that Dorothy can make her honey.
