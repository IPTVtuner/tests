S is feeling a bit sad but T, A and P are here to help and before long, everyone is tap dancing. Oh dear! T has no tea, A has too many apples but S is sagging so the others want to help. P pops in and they try some word magic - perhaps a comforting pat or a big musical number? This episode introduces the letters S, A, T and P and the words 'sat', 'pat', 'tap' and 'taps'.
