Bing and Sula are having so much fun playing together they don't want to say goodbye when Amma arrives to pick Sula up. To delay her departure Bing hides Sula's sparkly shoe in the toilet and it gets soaking wet much to Sula's annoyance. It looks as though Sula will have to hop home until Bing finds a way to turn the bad-bye back into a good-bye again.
