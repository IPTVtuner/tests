Norrie skips into the Clubhouse and greets her friends. As they greet her, they reminisce about when they first met. Arriving with her parents in a long limousine, Norrie, her parents and her 72 siblings flood out of the car. It's just Norrie who is going to stay at the Clubhouse, though, and enjoy some well-needed quiet. She can play alone and hear herself think.
