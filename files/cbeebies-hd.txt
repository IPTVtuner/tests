Joining Gail and Keith for today's GiggleQuiz are Rapids Johnson and Professor Muddles. Muddles reveals his latest invention: the Quiz Fit, which is designed to help Keith quiz and keep fit at the same time. After trying it on, Keith is soon jogging and hopping on the spot - until the Quiz Fit malfunctions and orders him to scoot, skate and swim all around the studio.
