It's Chinese Day at school and the children are really looking forward to a day of special Chinese-themed celebration, helped by Michael. As a special surprise, he's ordered a real Chinese dragon costume which Pat picks up at the sorting office to deliver to the school. On the way though, naughty horse Pumpkin gets the dragon's head stuck on his own and as he canters off into the fields.
