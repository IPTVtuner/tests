Joining Gail and Keith for today's quiz are Rapids Johnson and Professor Muddles. In the first round, the contestants fly paper aeroplanes around the studio. To tidy up the planes, Professor Muddles presents his latest invention: the Stretcherama 5000. The device stretches Professor Muddles' arms out so he can help pick up the aeroplanes without leaving his seat. But the Professor hasn't quite mastered controlling his long arms, so Arthur has to duck as they stretch over his desk.
