Duggee gets a delivery, which arrives in a big cardboard box. The squirrels discover that cardboard boxes can be very interesting - Roly makes a car out of one, Tag makes a tunnel and then all the squirrels make the biggest cardboard castle ever seen. They dress up as brave knights in cardboard costumes, but when they get to their castle they discover it is already occupied... by those naughty mice!
