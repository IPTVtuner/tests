Today, October 23
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the homemade beard and remembers the day she got it. James, Alice and Molly are exhausted because baby Maddy won't sleep. They think they've tried everything, but Molly points out they haven't tried Bob. Bob sings a lullaby, and it seems to work despite Moira nearly ruining things by using her loud vacuum cleaner nearby.
