Kugelis is a recipe from Lithuania that contains bacon and grated potato. Harry has so many potatoes to grate that he has to get his sister to help him! They both work incredibly hard to prepare the dish, which also uses eggs and spring onions. Harry cleverly decorates his table using traditional, beautifully coloured Lithuanian sashes. The kugelis is served with sour cream - let's hope Harry's friends love the taste!
