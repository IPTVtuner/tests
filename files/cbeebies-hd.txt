Today, July 01
Dee encourages a friend to say 'crab', and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. Today we see different crabs that can walk sideways, hide, have big claws or are colourful. Dee makes friends with a crab by the seaside and even meets a king crab. The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's word!
