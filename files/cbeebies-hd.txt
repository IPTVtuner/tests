Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how ducks play such an important role in the environment. They find out that ducks can carry seeds on their bodies so that plants find new places to grow and help keep nature in balance by eating slugs and snails. On the way, they discover that ducks recycle their own feathers in their nests to keep their eggs and babies warm and can help keep ponds and wetlands healthy!
