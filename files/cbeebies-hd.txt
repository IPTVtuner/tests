Meera's expecting a gecko to arrive and has got a tank all ready and cosy to greet her new pet, called George. Pat has collected him and is on his way - but the gecko has escaped and now everyone is looking all over Greendale for the little chap. The children join in, and with Meera's knowledge about geckos and Bill's skill at chirruping just like the little creature, he is soon found.
