Princess Purl has one more task to complete to stay a princess. She must dance with the very rare Zippopopomus before the castle bell rings three times. Everyone goes to look for it, but despite searching everywhere, no one can find it. Bob takes a rest to blow bubbles and suddenly the Zippopopomus appears, but as soon as the bubbles disappear, so does the rare creature.
