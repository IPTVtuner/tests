Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the litter badge and remembers the day she got it... Daisy has a day off and Mack wants to spend the afternoon alone with her. Daisy wants to pick up litter on the beach, and Molly volunteers to join them and invites all her friends to come along too. Mack isn't thrilled about this.
