Duggee is putting up a picture of himself and the old friends he grew up with, who are just like family to him. This inspires the Squirrels to take a photo of their own, so they take turns getting smartened up for the camera with varying degrees of success. After a number of experimental poses, they eventually settle on the perfect composition, until Tag spots Enid - she's part of the family too, so shouldn't she be in the photo?
