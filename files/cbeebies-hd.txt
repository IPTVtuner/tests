Yakka Dee! celebrates children communicating - because talking fills you up with whizz, pop, bang! In this episode, Dee encourages a friend to say 'worm' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. We see a long worm, a little worm and a squirmy worm. Look out for the speedy worm and the greedy worm, the jelly worm and the welly worm! Dee enjoys a glow worm and we see a little girl make a muddy worm from her finger.
