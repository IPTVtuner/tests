Today, December 28
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the golden envelope and remembers the day she got it. Moira is fretting about who should be named the Hubber of the Year. She can't decide. Alice suggests she give the award to Bob because he's always helping people. Moira thinks Bob is a good choice, but Bob thinks Mrs Juniper should get the award because she is always organising things.
