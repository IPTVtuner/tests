Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how blackbirds play an important role in the environment. They find out that blackbirds can adapt to living in the city by eating what they find and changing their song so it is heard above the city noise. They also learn that blackbirds recycle their nests and help plants grow in new places. On the way, they enjoy a picnic and try to spot blackbirds with their binoculars.
