Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how sunflowers play an important role in the environment. They find out that they are made up of lots of tiny nectar-filled flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. They also learn that they can be homes for insects like ladybirds, who protect them from other insects that like to munch on sunflowers. On the way, they enjoy some sunflower seed snacks and pretend to be sunflowers following the sun!
