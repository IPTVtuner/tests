Sula, Pando and Bing discover a bird's nest while making a playhouse in the shed. They try to find the bird by being super quiet, and she flies into their playhouse. When Bing goes in to look for her, she flies out again; they can't both be in the playhouse at the same time. So Bing decides to give the shed to her until her chicks have all grown up.
