Today, November 30
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the HRH place card and remembers the day she got it. Bob tells Molly that the Queen is coming to visit the Big Hub! Molly gets very excited and dashes off to tell Mrs Juniper. Mrs Juniper gets in a flap because she has nothing to wear and she will have to provide a banquet. Suki and Magnus decide to make the Queen a throne, and Ruby will make her a crown.
