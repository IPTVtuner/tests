The Squirrels are having fun playing games but are surprised to find out that Betty didn't always enjoy playing. Since her first day at Squirrel Club, she has always impressed everyone with her confidence and independence, but because she had grown up playing alone, she didn't know how to join in with the others. Luckily, Duggee had a great idea to bring all the Squirrels together. As a group, they performed the Squirrel Club song about their friends and what they're good at.
