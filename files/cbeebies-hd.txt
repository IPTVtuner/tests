Duggee and the Squirrels take their teddy bears out for a picnic. But hang on - who does that huge teddy belong to? Oh! That's not a teddy at all! It's Beryl, and she's a real bear! She wants to join in the fun but has no teddy of her own, so the Squirrels make her one using sticks, leaves, acorns... and a big pink sock! Now Beryl can join the picnic with everyone else.
