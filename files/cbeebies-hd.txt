Bitz, Bob, Bevel, Zip and Pop are making Purl a surprise birthday present, the best hairclip ever! They decide to make it from some of Purl's favourite things that they find in Tubely Jungle, but everyone collects so many things, including a smelly sock, that Bitz doesn't know where to start. And what's more, Purl thinks they have forgotten her birthday, so they need to make it fast.
