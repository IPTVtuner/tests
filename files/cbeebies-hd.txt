Bob really wants his castle to look more like Bitz's, and everyone pitches in to help, but things don't go to plan. The new drawbridge that Bevel, Zip and Pop have built collapses, making big holes in the castle wall. They also need to figure out how to get Bob's new Tower-Top Toy Room from the ground all the way to the top of his tower. It's time for a Bitz Brain Blitz.
