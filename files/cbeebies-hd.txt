On a camping trip to High Snowy Mountain, Bitz, Bob and Purl offer to help a very tired bear-sitter Bevel get two bear cubs to take their nap so he can arrange a surprise picnic for them. But the cheeky cubs keep waking up - and when they finally do go to sleep, Bevel is so tired he falls asleep as well! The trouble is that now Bevel is napping, the bear cubs are wide awake again, so they need to find a way to let tired Bevel sleep while the bear cubs enjoy a noisy picnic.
