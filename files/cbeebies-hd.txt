Eddie's mum is Italian and has taught him how to make a traditional Italian pizza. Eddie makes a delicious cheese and olive pizza using homemade dough and a tasty tomato sauce. His friends are in for a real treat when they see that Eddie's mum cooks the pizza in their traditional pizza oven. He tops his pizza with black olives, but some of Eddie's friends aren't too sure about olives when they taste them on their own.
