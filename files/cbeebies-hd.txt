Happy has always loved the water, even though it makes a mess. But while swimming around in his paddling pool at the playhouse, Duggee reminds the Squirrels that there was a time when Happy feared water. On Happy's first day, his mum drops him off and he is excited. He goes to play with Norrie and Roly and has loads of fun baking, playing with toys and jumping over puddles, but Happy can't do it.
