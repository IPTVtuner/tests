Two teams touch down at the STARS space station to take on three scientific challenges to win out-of-this world prizes. First, they must work out if an object is heavier or lighter than another, before placing it on a giant set of scales. Then, there's a game based on sound and pitch, as Sam and Ayo play a tune using three hidden jars filled with different volumes of water. The teams must then figure out which order the jars go in to make the tune.
