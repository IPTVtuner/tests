Two teams touch down at the STARS space station to take on three scientific challenges to win out-of-this world prizes. First, they must guide magnetic rockets out of the Magnet Maze, dodging comets and stars along the way. Then, the teams must work out which season James is talking about by standing under the correct tree. If they're correct, they'll get covered in spring blossom, summer sunlight, autumn leaves or winter snow!
