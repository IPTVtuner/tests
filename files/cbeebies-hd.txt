Bing and Flop are in the park when they see Pando on a skateboard. Bing is full of awe as he watches Pando skate up and down. He can't wait to have a go himself, but it's much harder to balance than Pando made it look. Bing falls off and bumps his knee, but Pando finds a clever way to help Bing get his confidence back.
