Bing wants to try Coco's hula hoop. It's harder than it looks, but they all find lots of other hoopy games on the way. Just as Bing almost gets it right, he gets carried away with spinning and breaks the hoop. Coco is upset she can't hula anymore - until Bing and Charlie remind her of all the other games they can still do with the bent hoop.
