Elsa is using salt fish to make a fishcake recipe she has learnt from her father. She starts by mashing potatoes with butter before adding lots of other tasty ingredients such as chives. Not everyone likes the taste of chives before they are cooked but hopefully they will enjoy them in the finished recipe. When her friends arrive, Elsa greets them with a special pineapple drink served in pineapple-shaped cups.
