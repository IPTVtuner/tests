Pat has a special delivery for Amy - a brand-new very special breed of sheep. However, on the way to Amy's, the new sheep escapes and gets mixed up with all the other Greendale sheep! The new sheep leads all the others on a romp through Pencaster. Then Pat realises that Bonnie the dog isn't just a very cute ball of fur - she's also a rather good sheep dog.
