When Kwazii discovers a blue whale with an injured tail, the Octonauts attempt to use a giant net and Octofloats to keep it from sinking. Meanwhile, Peso and Tweak collaborate on a special brace for its tail, and Kwazii, Dashi and Shellington try to find it enough food. But when the supporting net breaks, the Octonauts have to launch an emergency free-fall rescue.
