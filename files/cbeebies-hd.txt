When the Globe's new owner Archibald Frost threatens to knock down the theatre to build a skyscraper, William Shakespeare and his players spring into action to convince him that plays are fun by staging As You Like It. The story begins with two brothers: kind Orlando and mean Oliver. Oliver refuses to share any of their father's money with Orlando. Shakespeare introduces two more bickering brothers: nasty Duke Frederick and friendly Duke Senior.
