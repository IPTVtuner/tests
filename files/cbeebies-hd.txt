Bing wants Flop to read him his favourite book as he has his bath, but Bing joins in with the story too enthusiastically. Flop suggests they finish the story in bed as books don't like baths. When the book falls into the bath, Bing is heartbroken, but Flop helps him to understand that even though the book is wet the story isn't.
