Dee encourages a friend to say `train' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. We see lots of different types of train: a long train, a fast train, a slow train and a choo-choo train. There is an animal train, a scrummy train made of food and everyone has a ride on a miniature train. The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's word.
