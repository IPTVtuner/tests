Topsy is feeling much better, but she's bored of resting and there's nothing fun she can do! So when she hears DIY Derek next door and his new little dog Teddy, she's really excited and plays with Teddy. Later, Grandma phones to say her dog, Mossy, isn't feeling very good, so Mummy and Topsy go to Grandma's, taking one of Teddy's snacks, Topsy's vet set and a tennis ball with them. When Topsy shows Mossy the tennis ball, Mossy wags her tail and cheers up!
