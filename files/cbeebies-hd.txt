The Squirrels are playing outside, when out of a bush jumps the cutest creature they ever did see. They think it is simply adorable and tell it so? with startling results. The creature bursts into tears! The creature, whose name is Plinky, tells them her whole family are monsters, and that's what she's supposed to be, but she just cannot get the hang of it. The Squirrels are keen to help Plinky get in touch with her scary side. Fortunately, Duggee has his monster badge.
