Dee encourages a friend to say 'milk' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. There's white milk, pink milk, baby milk and banana milk. We snuggle up for bedtime milk and even enjoy some mighty milk and monster milk! The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's word!
