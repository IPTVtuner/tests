Dee encourages a friend to say 'h', and we go on an adventure around the sound. We see a helicopter, look inside a house and hug a hamster! The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's letter sound.
