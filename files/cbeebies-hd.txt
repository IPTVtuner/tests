Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how ivy plays an important role in the environment. They find out that ivy is an evergreen plant, so it provides shelter the whole year round to insects, birds and other animals. They learn that it can also be a food source for lots of creatures, like birds, which eat the ivy's berries in winter. On the way, they walk like dinosaurs and spot a spider who has spun its web in the ivy.
