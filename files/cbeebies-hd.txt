Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the googley face and remembers the day she got it. The Hub is full of activity. Euan and his mum have been given a forever home to live in. They have to move in straight away, so everyone is pitching in to help them gather items they will need for their new home. Moira tells Caitlin that Euan might not feel at home right away in his new bedroom. Caitlin has an idea, she'll make Euan a special gift for his room.
