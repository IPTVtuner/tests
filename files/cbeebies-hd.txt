Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the sock and remembers the day she got it. The kids have been rehearsing for a puppet show using Alice's precious puppets. Mack picks them up and puts them into a brown Big Hub bag, but he accidently swaps identical bags with Moira. Later, Molly opens the bag expecting to find puppets but discovers lost property instead. Mack has lost Alice's puppets! Luckily, Molly has an idea.
