Maddie visits a forklift warehouse. She discovers how a forklift truck uses something called counterbalance to lift things really high without tipping over. She attaches a special camera to the forks of the truck to see it in action as it lifts heavy things up onto shelves. Next, she visits a dried fruit factory to see how lots of fun machines turn fresh apples into dried apple crisps. Maddie uses her special slow-motion camera to see how the apples are chopped.
