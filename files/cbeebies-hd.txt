The Squirrels are having a picnic and notice that the chickens eat differently than they do. Duggee has his eating badge and can explain all the different ways animals eat. Some animals eat slowly like cows, who eat all day long. But others eat quickly like frogs. Some, like goats, are always eating, while tortoises can go a whole year without food. Some animals eat food that is very high up, like giraffes, and some eat food that is very low down, like moles.
