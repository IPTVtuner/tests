Baby Soup Dragon is upset because his mother won't let him use her big ladle and help make the soup. Tiny and Small tell him not to worry - he can help them instead. He does, and he enjoys it so much that he decides he wants to be a Clanger instead of a Soup Dragon. But after a little while, the Clangers are not so sure this is a good idea!
