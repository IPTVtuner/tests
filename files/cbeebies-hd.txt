Kika is a golden Labrador and a guide dog for her owner, Dr Amit, who is blind, which means he cannot see. She is trained to use her supersight to help Dr Amit do as many things as he can by himself. Together, they make the best team! Dr Amit has a very important letter to post. But first, he and Kika need to buy a stamp at the shop in time to catch the last post.
