Meagaidh the Border Collie is a search and rescue dog who works with her owner Tom. Her supernose follows scents and smells like clues, so they can rescue people who need their help. Joe and his daughter Kate are in trouble at the top of a really steep hill. They are lost, cold, soggy, tired and hungry. And they've dropped their picnic bag down a hill. Joe manages to contact Tom at the Woofton Search and Rescue Centre, just before the battery on his phone runs out.
