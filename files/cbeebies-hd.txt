Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how acorns play an important role in the environment. They find out how tiny acorns can grow into giant oak trees that live for hundreds of years and that acorns are a great food source for animals like squirrels who bury them to eat in winter. On the way, they spot a woodpecker's nest in an oak tree and learn that oak trees support more life than any other tree in the UK - all thanks to the tiny acorn.
