Maddie learns about colourful things. She visits a climbing wall centre, where she finds out how colourful holds on the wall help us to climb up it. And we learn how an auto-belay is used to help us to go up and down the wall safely. Next, Maddie heads to a modelling clay factory to see how brightly coloured modelling clay contains a plant ingredient called starch to make it thick. Maddie uses her special time-lapse camera to let us see all the ingredients mixed together.
