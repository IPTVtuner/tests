Maddie is using her senses to see and hear. She visits a speaker factory to understand what happens when we listen to music from a speaker. With the help of her special slow-motion camera, Maddie shows how vibrations make the speaker cones move up and down, creating the sounds we can hear. Next, Maddie is learning about colours, and how by mixing the primary colours of red, blue and yellow together we can make new colours called secondary colours.
