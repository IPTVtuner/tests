Meet Orson, our talented cook from the Midlands. Orson is cooking his very special version of bakewell tart for his friends. Some people say that a bakewell tart recipe comes from the Midlands, so Orson's version should be very good. Let's hope his friends like it too! He is using lots of delicious ingredients like raspberry jam and flaked almonds but is really hoping that his friends will like the lemony taste of the tart, as this is his special ingredient.
