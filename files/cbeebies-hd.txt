Two teams touch down at the STARS space station to take on three scientific challenges to win out-of-this world prizes. First, they must decide whether objects will float or sink in a water tank. Then, in a game based on light and shadows, the young scientists have to figure out what their team captains are holding by observing their shadows behind a huge screen. Finally, the teams learn about structures by building arched bridges they can step across to reach an island.
