Today, January 30
Dee encourages a friend to say 'v', and we go on an adventure around the sound. We see a van and a volcano, and meet a violet violin! The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's letter sound.
