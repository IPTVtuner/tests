Can Tortoise beat Hare in a race? Hare doesn't think so. She's so confident that she can beat Tortoise, she goes out to a disco the night before the race. Tortoise, on the other hand, eats a healthy meal and goes to bed early. Who will win the race? Musicians from the BBC Philharmonic are joined by broadcaster Nihal Arthanayake to share a musical retelling of this sporty fairy tale.
