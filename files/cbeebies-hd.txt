When Jen accidentally grinds up some giraffe thorn tree seeds that Mr Hammond wanted Andy to plant, Andy must head to the Namibian desert in southern Africa to track some down. And what better way to do that than from the top of a giraffe itself! But when another male giraffe arrives on the scene, a fight ensues, and Andy is caught in the middle.
