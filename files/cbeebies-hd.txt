It's a lovely day, so everyone is playing outside. Things take a turn when Roly needs a wee, because the door is locked and Duggee has mislaid the key. The Squirrels start looking around for it, but they have no luck. Not to worry, Duggee has his metal detector, Helen. After demonstrating it to the Squirrels, they are very keen to give it a go.
