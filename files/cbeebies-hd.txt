Dan the border collie is a search and rescue dog who works with his owner Jamie. His super nose follows scents and smells like clues so they can rescue people who need their help. Dan is busy digging a hole when his owner Jamie gets a very important phone call - police officer Penny needs them to go to Woofton Woods to look for a lost birdwatcher who is out trying to spot a rare bird, the Woofton woodpecker.
