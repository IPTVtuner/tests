Newfoundland Sylvie is a big therapy dog with big soft cuddles who loves to help people when they're worried. She and her owner Katrina visit all sorts of people every day, young and old. Sylvie has a bit of a sniffle, so Katrina makes an appointment for her to see the vet. It's usually Sylvie's job to help others feel calm, but now she needs to help herself. Katrina always gets worried when Sylvie is poorly, so she needs to calm Katrina's nerves.
