Dee encourages a friend to say 'n', and we go on an adventure around the sound. We see a nest, some noses and a net, and watch some newts eat noodles at night! The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's letter sound.
