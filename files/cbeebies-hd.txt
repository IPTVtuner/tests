Dee encourages a friend to say `kite' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. We see lots of different kites and see how they fly and move. There's a flying kite, a lion-shaped kite, a dragon kite and a striped kite. There's a windy kite, a stuck kite and even a snoring kite! Dee and her friends all fly their kites together.
