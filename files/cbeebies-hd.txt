Maddie is learning all about baggage. She visits an airport to see how baggage goes from the check-in desk and onto an aeroplane using something called a destination tag, which makes sure each piece of baggage ends up on the right plane. She attaches her special cameras onto the suitcase as it goes along the baggage carousel, it goes up, down and around until it reaches a room called the baggage room. Next, Maddie visits a rucksack factory to see how a rucksack is made.
