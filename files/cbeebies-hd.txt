Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how seaweed plays such an important role in the environment. They find out that seaweed can be a shelter for lots of sea creatures, a great place for seabirds to look for food to eat, and that seaweed helps provide some of the oxygen we breathe. On the way, they see what they can spot in a rock pool and have a picnic of some snacks made from seaweed!
