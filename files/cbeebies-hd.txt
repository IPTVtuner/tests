Major invents a Clanger finder, but it is not very useful - it always finds the Clanger who is holding it. Major is disappointed - he hadn't thought of that. But Granny comes up with a better suggestion to keep him busy: he could mend their clock, which hasn't worked for some time. Major Clanger has a think, then brightens up immediately. He can do better than that - he will build a new clock, and it will be his best invention ever. But it turns out the others don't agree.
