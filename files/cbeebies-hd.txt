Bing and Sula are planting seeds at Amma's when Coco arrives with her new skipping rope. Coco teaches them how to skip, with Sula picking it up quicker than Bing. Just when Bing thinks he has succeeded, he hurts his leg on the watering can. Bing can't understand why he is not as good as Sula, but Coco shows Bing that, with some help, he can learn to skip too.
