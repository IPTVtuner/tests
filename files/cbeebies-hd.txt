During a game of Follow the Leader on Far Away Island, Bitz and Bob bump into Ranger Bevel, who is helping guide some frogs to water as it's `froggy dude migration day'. But when the frogs struggle to get across a big wide gully, Bitz finds a way to help them by building a strong bridge. However, once they arrive at the sea it turns out they don't like saltwater, so now they need to find them a suitable pond.
