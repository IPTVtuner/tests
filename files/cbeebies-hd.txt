Two teams touch down at the STARS space station to take on three scientific challenges to win out-of-this world prizes. First, they must match a sequence of colours given to them by mixing primary colours to make secondary ones. Then, in a game based on light and shadows, the young scientists have to figure out what their team captains are holding by observing their shadows behind a huge screen. Finally, the teams dress as bees with sticky legs to transfer pollen between giant flowers.
