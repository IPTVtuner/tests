Tinks is a disability assistance dog for her owner Charli, who has a condition that makes it painful for her to pick things up or to push and pull things. Tinks uses her superfetch skills to help Charli every day. The smallest of the Dog Squad gang, Tinks is a little Lhasa Apso with lots of big dog energy. Charli has been invited to a party but is feeling a bit nervous about going.
