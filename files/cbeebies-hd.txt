The Squirrels have just got some new walkie-talkies and are having so much fun with them. Duggee calls the Squirrels to come for some blueberry juice, but as Tag is running, he trips over a car and falls through a secret door in the wall. Communicating through his walkie-talkie, Tag doesn't know where he is. He can see lots and lots of things around him, but no-one has any idea where this room is in the house.
