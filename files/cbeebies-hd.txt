Today, March 24
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the gift bow and remembers the day she got it. It's Mack's birthday, but he's a little disappointed as it appears that everyone has forgotten, even James. Of course, James does have a surprise planned for later, but he and Molly are keeping it a secret from him for now. Mack is convinced Dad won't forget and recruits Caitlin to help him find out if any special plans are afoot.
