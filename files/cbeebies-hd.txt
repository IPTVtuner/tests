Today, December 29
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the pottery tile and remembers the day she got it. Molly meets a new stall owner, Alice, and shows her round the Big Hub. While Molly takes Alice for a drink in the Wobbly Coffee Pot, James and Mack bring Alice's boxes in to set up the stall, but James drops one of the boxes, smashing some of her pottery.
