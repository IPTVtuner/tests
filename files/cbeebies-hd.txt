Naima's family are from Algeria. Naima is cooking a special Algerian borek for her friends to try. Borek is made from pastry, mashed potato, meat, cheese and olives. The great thing about borek is that you can add lots of different ingredients depending on what you like, and that's exactly what Naima is doing today. Naima mashes her potatoes, cuts some spring onions and sprinkles in some cinnamon before she gets the table ready for her Algerian feast.
