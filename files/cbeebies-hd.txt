Eden and Ava make their very own necklaces using colourful beads. Eden kindly makes one for her best friend and gives it to her as a surprise. Later, the sisters go roller-skating in the park. It's Ava's first time skating on her own, but luckily Eden has lots of good tips for her. Will Ava be able to keep up with her big sister and become a super skater?
