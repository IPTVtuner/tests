Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the little toy donkey and remembers the day she got it. Molly and Mack are visiting Daisy at the vet's when she gets a call from Mrs Anderson. Daisy seems a little stressed by this, so Molly and Mack decide to follow her to the farm to find out what's going on. At the Kids Club, Moira finds Lennox's jokes hilarious, but unfortunately not James's. James takes this on as a challenge - he must make Moira laugh.
