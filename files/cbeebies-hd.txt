Today, February 10
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the squidgy magic ball and remembers the day she got it. Mack is helping Kez with her boxes, but Moira says they need to be moved out of the way. Kez tries to distract her with a magic trick, but Moira insists the boxes need to be gone. At the Kids Club, Caitlin is trying to do a magic trick with Euan, but her disappearing-the-ball trick doesn't quite work.
