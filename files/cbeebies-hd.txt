Mrs Farrell and the children create a class charter - a list of rules to follow to all get along with one another at school. The class puts the rules into practice by sharing together and being kind to each other. Ottilie and Felicity find out how to look after the Giant African land snails. Leon takes charge of keeping the classroom tidy and ends up being awarded a certificate for all his hard work.
