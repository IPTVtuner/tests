Valentina is making a Greek vegetarian moussaka for her friends because her family is from Greece. Her delicious recipe is loaded with fresh vegetables such as courgettes and aubergines and topped with green lentils packed with goodness. She finishes it off by making a yoghurt topping and covering everything with grated cheese. Some of Valentina's friends don't like the taste of cooked aubergine on its own.
