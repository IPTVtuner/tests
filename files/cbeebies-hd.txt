Norrie is having fun looking at nature in the garden. When Roly wants to join in, she tells him he needs to be really quiet, but he gets overexcited, shouting so loudly that he scares a lovely butterfly away. Norrie is put out because Roly did the opposite of what she said. When Roly asks what an opposite is, Norrie struggles to explain. Luckily, Duggee has his Opposites Badge and helps the squirrels understand by using lots of fun examples.
