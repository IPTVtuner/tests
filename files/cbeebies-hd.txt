The train station in Pencaster is getting a brand-new stained-glass window, but the locals think that the new modern art window isn't all that great. Pat's job is to deliver it but when it gets a dangerous crack in it during the journey Ajay says he can't accept the delivery. Pat knows exactly who to ask for help and the children of Greendale School find their mosaic picture of Greendale comes in handy.
