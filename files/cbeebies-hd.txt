Kika is a golden labrador and a guide dog for her owner Dr Amit, who is blind, which means he cannot see. She is trained to use her super sight to help Dr Amit do as many things as he can by himself. Together, they make the best team! Dr Amit is showing his children Abhi and Anoushka how to read braille, a special pattern of clever dots that helps people to read using their fingers.
