The class has a visit from Karen, the dental nurse, who shows them how to keep their teeth clean. She asks Jud to be a pretend dentist and give Oliver's teeth a check-over, but how many teeth does he have? Jud, Oliver and Jessica are then given the chance to practise their brushing skills with Karen. She gives them some top tips to make sure they always have gleaming white smiles. Solomon is in the dental surgery role play area.
