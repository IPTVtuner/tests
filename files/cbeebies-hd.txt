David and Zak were meant to be working on a school project together but they seem to be arguing about everything, all of the time. Kobi and Grandma Zainab can't agree on anything either as they argue about looking after tomato plants. Thankfully Kobi and Grandma Zainab can look beyond their own little disagreement to tell David and Zak that two things can be right at the same time and that there isn't always one solution to a problem.
