Yakka Dee! celebrates children communicating - because talking fills you up with whizz, pop, bang! In this episode, Dee encourages a friend to say 'mouse' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. We see lots of different beans and explore how they look and taste. We see red beans, green beans, long, thin and lean beans. We see a friend grow some beans, pick them and then eat them for tea.
