Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the wobbly coffee pot mug and remembers the day she got it. Moira reads a bad online review of the Big Hub and worries that if word gets out, it will have to close. The review describes Kez's stall as messy, so Moira decides to hold a stall inspection to sort things out. Although Molly loves the creative chaos of Kez's stall, she agrees to help Kez tidy up before the inspection.
