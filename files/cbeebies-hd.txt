Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how dead wood plays an important role in the environment. They find out that even though the wood is no longer alive, dead wood is a home for animals, insects, birds and fungi, and learn that dead wood breaks down to give nutrients back to the soil. On the way, they have a game of tag by an upright dead tree called a snag!
