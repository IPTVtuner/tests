Dan the border collie is a search and rescue dog who works with his owner Jamie. His super nose follows scents and smells like clues, so they can rescue people who need their help. A mountain biker called Eddie hasn't made it back from a ride with his friends, and it's starting to get dark. Police officer Penny needs Jamie and Dan's help with a night search. They head to where he was last seen, and a friendly owl helps Dan find his scent.
