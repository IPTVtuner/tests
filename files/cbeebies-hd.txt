Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how orchards play an important role in the environment. They find out that orchards are mosaic habitats which attract lots of different plants and wildlife and provide shelter and protection for so many creatures. On the way, they spot some fallen fruit that is great for animals to eat and try some fruit that grows in an orchard which they can enjoy too!
