It's time for the annual Greendale Duck Race - where everyone has a little rubber duck and they race them down the River Penn. Alf and Ted reminisce about old times when they raced ducks as kids and realise that there was some cheating going on in the past. Ted and Alf decide to race again this year and each has something to prove.
