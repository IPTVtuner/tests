Today, April 11
Dee encourages a friend to say `carrot', and goes on a whirlwind word adventure. See lots of carrots, a long carrot, a baby carrot, a nosey carrot, a big carrot and a cool carrot. See Dee and a friend eat a crunchy carrot, and Dee has fun jumping on a bumpy carrot. The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's word.
