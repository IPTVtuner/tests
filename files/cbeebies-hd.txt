Catfish is a popular fish in Thailand and today Pearlina is serving it with sticky rice. She works hard in the kitchen, combining lots of ingredients to make a special Thai dressing to brush all over the fish. Before they come over, Pearlina's friends taste one of her important ingredients - lemongrass. They're not too keen on it at first, but Pearlina hopes they will like the taste of lemongrass when they taste it in her finished recipe.
