Today, January 11
With a puff of smoke, Wizard Tripwick appears and bumbles his way into his classroom. Once inside, loveable Wizard Tripwick does his best to teach his wizarding pupils a spell to make bananas appear out of thin air. Down on the allotment, Humphrey is intrigued by his neighbour's metal detector and quickly gets to work looking for buried treasure. Humphrey's search sends his neighbour tumbling into a hole, but together they make an exciting find.
