Big Bob, the bell from the church tower of Reverend Timms' church has been away to get mended. The children have prepared a special bell-ringing tune - Big Bob is coming back. Pat has to deliver it to the church in time for the installation people to pop it in the bell-tower. However, what started as a windy day turns into a gale, trees are blown down and the bell people can't get through.
