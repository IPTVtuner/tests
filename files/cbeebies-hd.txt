Esmae is inviting her friends to her special seaside themed meal, complete with everyone's favourite seaside food. Esmae serves delicious fish with sweet potato wedges and tartar sauce, which contains her special ingredient - capers. Her friends are not too sure about the taste of capers when they try them before the meal, but let's hope Esmae can change their minds with the finished sauce. Esmae has even decorated her table to look like the beach!
