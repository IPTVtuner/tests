Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how dandelions play an important role in the environment. They find out how they spread their seeds in all sorts of places, that they have amazing roots called tap roots and learn how bees and other insects love the dandelion's nectar. On the way, they visit a flower shop and help some dandelions find new places to grow by blowing on them.
