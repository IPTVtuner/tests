It?s clear that little Finn is worried about his dad?s plans to perform at the community festival. Errol?s trying to do lots of acrobatic tricks but none of them seem to work. Taking a leaf from her Great Uncle Owa, Sam advises Finn and Errol to focus on one trick at a time. Even with Sam?s advice Errol doesn?t look like he?ll be ready in time until Sam comes up with a genius plan inspired by a book about the circus.
