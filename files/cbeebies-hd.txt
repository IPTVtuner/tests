Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how puddles play an important role in the environment. They find out that puddles are part of the water cycle and that they can support birds, animals, insects and plants too. They learn how raindrops and lakes can be a bit like puddles, and on the way, there is plenty of puddle-splashing fun to be had.
