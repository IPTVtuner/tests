The Squirrels are out walking around in the rain with Duggee and notice a rainbow. But before they know it, it's gone and the Squirrels are devastated. They decide to make their own rainbow and go off in search of all the colours from everything around them, including strawberries, carrots and bananas. Duggee shows the Squirrels what he has been working on too, a rainbow cake.
