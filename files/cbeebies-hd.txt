Today, December 30
It's the day of the kite festival and first up are Zip and Pop, who dazzle the crowd with their performance. Then Bitz and Bob take to the arena, but their kites don't even get off the ground. Finally it's Bevel and Purl's turn, but Bevel tries kite-flying with no hands and loses them. Things take a turn for the worse when Zip grabs on to Pop's kite and gets swept away by the wind. Bitz and Bob have to work out how to get their kites to fly in order to rescue Zip.
