Mummy hurt her arm and missed Topsy and Tim's nursery school play, The Three Little Pigs but all is not lost. The twins have a surprise planned. They invite their nursery friends round and perform the play at home, especially for Mummy and Grandma, with Dad playing the part of one of the little pigs!
