It's Diwali, and the class has visitors who have come to tell them about the meaning behind the festival of light. The children have a go at making rangoli with Mrs Hussain and try some tasty Indian sweets. Jessica, Theo and Alba are creating some diya lamps out of clay with the help of Miss Gerrard and some hungry crocodiles! The lamps are part of a special display, and the class celebrate all they have learnt.
