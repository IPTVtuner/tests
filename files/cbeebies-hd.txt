Bitz and Bob are helping famous artist La Purl move a very large rock across the beach, as she needs it for a mysterious work of art. They try rolling it, but it's too heavy. Expert rock movers Bevel, Zip and Pop arrive, but they can't move it either. Looking for things to help them, Bitz finds some logs to roll the rock, but Bevel stops to eat a banana and the rock rolls off out of control, causing the logs to go everywhere. But maybe floating the rock would work.
