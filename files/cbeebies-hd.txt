Bob is looking after Phoebe's cute little puppy called Earl, but when they take him for walkies he gets lost inside Bitz's amazing maze. First Bevel tries to guide them to Earl from the castle, but he can't see the whole maze as he's not high enough and there's a hot air balloon in the way. Bitz decides to use the balloon to go much higher so she can see the whole maze clearly, then she can give everyone the correct instructions to get to Earl.
