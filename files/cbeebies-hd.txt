Annabel's mum has shown her a special way to make a traditional Austrian desert called Kaiserschmarren, which she serves with blueberries and raspberries. Austria is famous for wonderful cakes, pastries and puddings, so let's hope that Annabel's friends like it as much as she does. Annabel dresses in traditional clothing and invites her friends to eat in her wooden Austrian chalet.
