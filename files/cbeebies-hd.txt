Today, November 19
Dee encourages a friend to say `tiger' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. We see a big tiger, a baby tiger, a stripy tiger and a growling tiger. We meet a swimming tiger, a climbing tiger, a cheeky tiger and even a tiger at a tea party! The journey is repeated with some surprises along the way and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's word!
