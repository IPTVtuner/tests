Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the fairy wand and remembers the day she got it... James asks the kids what wish they would make if they could wish for anything at all. Suki wants to be a vet, Magnus wants to build a robot and Ruby wants to feed pigs. Molly says she would like to be a fairy godmother and make all of her friends' wishes come true. She persuades Daisy to take Suki and Ruby to the farm.
