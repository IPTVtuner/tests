Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how the wind plays an important role in the environment. They find out that the wind makes waves on the sea and that it can help boats and birds to travel more quickly. On the way, they spot a washing line with clothes drying in the wind and blow some bubbles to show how the wind helps seeds to grow in new places.
