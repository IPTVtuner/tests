Two teams touch down at the STARS space station to take on three scientific challenges to win out-of-this world prizes. First, they must decide whether objects will float or sink in a water tank. Then there's a healthy eating quiz based on the food groups that make up a balanced diet. Finally, the teams dress as bees with sticky legs to transfer pollen between giant flowers. Meanwhile, Ayo wants to discover a planet just like one of her heroes, astronomer Sara Seager.
