Bitz and Purl have started the Amazing Owl Club, with its own rulebook, a members-only clubhouse and, best of all, a special badge with flapping owl wings. The badge allows entry to the clubhouse! Bob, Bevel, Zip and Pop manage to join the club by doing three amazingly owly things, but no one can copy Bitz's badge. Bitz needs to reverse-engineer her badge so everyone can see how it works.
