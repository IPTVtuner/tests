Everyone is practising their acts for the big talent show, and Purl has even made a beautiful sparkly curtain for the front of the stage. Unfortunately the curtain won't go up or down, and Bob is feeling nervous about performing in front of everyone. So while Bitz tries to get the curtain working, Bob has to try to overcome his nerves and keep the audience happy with a song. Thankfully, Purl is there to help, and the show, and the curtain, are a huge success.
