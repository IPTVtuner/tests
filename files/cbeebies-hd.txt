Lexi and her family are from Wales and she is cooking Glamorgan sausages using two very special Welsh ingredients. Lexi uses Caerphilly cheese in her recipe, but her most important ingredient is leek, the Welsh national vegetable. She cuts, crumbles, rolls and cooks all the ingredients together into sausage shapes before serving them to her friends on her Welsh-themed table.
