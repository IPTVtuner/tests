Bing sees Coco with a plaster on her finger and of course he wants one too. In the absence of a real plaster, Bing makes one out of sticky tape, but it's so sticky that it hurts when he tries to take it off. Bing doesn't want Flop to help so Flop comes up with a new game so that Bing can do it himself.
