Police Chief Bevel has his hands full trying to stop rowdy rascals Zip and Pop on their noise-making spree in Craft City. Luckily, superheroes Woolly Wonder Girl, Zap Girl and Mega-Super-Robo-Bob are on hand to help. But when Bevel and the rowdy rascals end up careering out of control through the streets of the city on a runaway skateboard, the superheroes need to create something strong and soft using threads of yarn to help stop them safely.
