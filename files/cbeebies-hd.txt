A Skymoo accidentally knocks the Iron Chicken out of her nest, and in falling to the surface of the Clangers' planet she hurts her wing. But although Major Clanger manages to mend it, she has lost her confidence and can't fly. It takes all the ingenuity of Small Clanger, and another intervention by the Skymoo, to get her back to her nest under her own wing power.
