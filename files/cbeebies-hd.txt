Malika shows us how to make her family recipe for fish ball tagine. Malika's dad is Moroccan and he has taught Malika to cook this tasty dish for her friends. She uses fresh fish poached in a range of spices and flavours including saffron, which makes the food turn a lovely yellow colour. Malika cooks the fish in a traditional Moroccan tagine, which has a cone shaped lid and a round pot. It's perfect for slow cooking fish, vegetables and even meat.
