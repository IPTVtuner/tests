Maddie looks at the emergency services. She uses a special camera to find out how the hose on a fire engine works and how the pump inside the fire engine creates pressure and sends water to the hose. Next, Maddie sees how an ordinary white car is made into a police car using special blue and yellow reflective stickers. A microscope camera reveals the tiny prisms inside the stickers, which make them bright and shiny.
