Together
Today, February 27
Charlie and the Rich brothers are in York, helping a couple who have spent two years painstakingly renovating their terraced home. With a very very small garden, full of crazy paving and building materials, Charlie and the boys compete to give it a Â£5K facelift, turning it into a luxurious haven to relax and entertain in.
