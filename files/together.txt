Together
Today, December 15
When Doctor Thorne's penniless niece Mary is excluded from the wedding preparations of her childhood playmate, she probes her uncle about the circumstances of her birth. She is devastated to learn that she is the illegitimate child of his late brother, and it seems she has neither breeding nor fortune. This is a problem as Mary and Frank - heir to the local Greshamsbury estate - have fallen in love.
