Together
Today, February 29
Charlie Dimmock and the Rich Brothers are in Bedford competing to design a garden for busy single mum Sam and her six-year-old daughter Amy. The garden is overgrown and unloved and badly in need of some TLC. Sam dreams of a trampoline for Amy, a seating area for herself and a colour-filled oasis bursting with oriental style plants.
