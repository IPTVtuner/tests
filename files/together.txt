Today, February 02
The team tackle the restoration of the blacksmith's forge, which involves a full five days and nights making bricks. As Christmas nears, they must source a Yule log, and Ruth winter-proofs the cottage, making a paper blanket and remedies for chilblains, rheumatism, coughs and colds. Also, Ruth enlists the help of the world's only Christmas cracker historian, Peter Kimpton.
