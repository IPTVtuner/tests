Together
Today, March 23
An adaptation of George Orwell's classic comic novel about an advertising executive who rebels against the system and a life ruled by money. At the height of the 1930s depression, he begins to question his values, and his wife has to stand patiently by as he rebels against all the institutions he sees as bourgeois and experiments with a life in which financial constraints are irrelevant.
