Today, September 18
Ruth visits Carnfield Hall in Derbyshire and its owner James Cartland; member of the Cartland dynasty and cousin of author Barbara Cartland. Carnfield Hall is a hotchpotch of Elizabethan, Jacobean and Victorian architecture with a 16th century great parlour and a staircase dating from 1628. Ruth thinks that the answer to Carnfield's future security lies with the estate's 90 acres of unused parkland.
