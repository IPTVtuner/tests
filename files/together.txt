Ruth joins John and Flavia Philips at Heath House, their gothic mansion in rural Staffordshire. John's family have lived on the land as far back as the 16th century, and the house has stood since 1840. Now in their 70s, John and Flavia are finding the property, along with the 480 acres of land, is becoming a financial and physical drain on them. The Philips believe the only way out is to sell Heath House.
