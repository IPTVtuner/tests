Kelly House is a Grade I listed building in Devon that dates back to the 1740s. However, years of neglect due to lack of funds mean that behind its crumbling fa√ßade lie walls plagued by dry rot, ceilings bowed by damp, and a roof that desperately needs replacing. Ruth Watson persuades Warin Kelly to set up a training programme for fledgling craftsmen to learn their trade while the house benefits from their work.
