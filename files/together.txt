Together
Today, November 11
Rajeena and Hardeep have moved to their dream house in Great Glen with its incredible views. But they are overlooked and their garden is an uninspiring blank canvas with an ugly bank of grass that obscures their vista. They dream of a traditional garden with a modern twist. The bank needs sorting and they want an entertaining area that capitalises on their view across the fields. A water feature and privacy is also important.
