Together
Today, August 24
Sakinah and Zumri from Hull have a bland, featureless garden, and they are at a loss as to what to do about it. They dream of having a grow-your-own space that doubles up as a wildlife haven so they can teach their two children about food and the environment. They would also love a pond. Can Charlie, the queen of water features, and the Rich brothers work their magic to create a food-producing family space that will attract the bugs, birds and bees on a budget of Â£4,000?
