Together
Today, January 13
In 2007, Nick and Talitha Bailey-Brain, who live near Usk in south Wales, impulsively bought two fields where they plan to make a smallholding life for themselves. Talitha grew up on a smallholding in Zimbabwe and Nick was a driver in the RAF before being medically discharged, and now, more passionate about trucks than tractors, his dream is to build a large barn in which to house his collection of flat-beds and diggers.
