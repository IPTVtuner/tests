Today, March 13
It's May and, with Empire Day approaching, a very special boat comes to the Valley. The paddle steamer, Monarch, is arriving: one of only three in the country that's still operational. It's the first time such a vessel has arrived at Morwellham Quay in 80 years. Back in the Edwardian period thousands of tourists began coming to the Tamar Valley by paddle steamer every summer.
