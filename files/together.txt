Together
Today, March 06
The last programme in the series sees Ruth, Nick and Tom carrying Barber & Goodman's Pharmacy through to the end of the Victorian era. Tom pulls some teeth as he branches out into dentistry, photography starts to become a popular hobby and Ruth investigates the changing times for women at the end of the 19th century - exploring Victorian contraception, even making some condoms out of sheep's intestines.
