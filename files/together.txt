Together
Today, November 18
It's July and time to bring in the cherry harvest with the help of Dartmoor pony Laddy. Historian Ruth Goodman tries her hand at salmon netting, while archaeologists Alex Langlands and Peter Ginn try to save their potato crop from being destroyed by blight. Alex goes to an Edwardian school room to recruit a traditional rural source of cheap labour: children. Ruth learns how to make a bathing suit from wool.
