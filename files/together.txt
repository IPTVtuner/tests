Together
Today, March 11
Whitbourne Hall is a vast Palladian-style mansion built in 1860. Tucked away in the Worcestershire countryside, it was taken on in the 1970s by a group of friends who set up a `community' to live, work and eat together. Restoring the stunning property has been a labour of love for the Whitbourners but the Hall still requires tens of thousands of pounds for restoration.
