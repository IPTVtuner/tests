Together
Today, November 16
It's winter in Snowdonia. As storms batter the mountains of north Wales, five farming families battle the elements to rear their animals as they prepare for a year like no other. On the slopes of Cadair Idris, husband and wife Ken and Lisa Markham are gathering their flock of Welsh mountain sheep into the pens, but with the wind and rain beating down, herding their animals is challenging work for them and their team of trusty sheepdogs.
