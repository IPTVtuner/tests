Together
Today, April 11
Beverly can't stand Matt LeBlanc and the feeling is mutual. As it's all she can do not to throttle the star of her show, Beverly leaves Sean to look after him, leading to an extended adventure in Las Vegas. Soon the two guys have bonded, leaving Beverly feeling excluded by her husband's new bromance. Later, in a confrontation with Matt, Beverly learns just how `big' a star Matt LeBlanc actually is.
