Together
Today, November 20
While Frank and Mary plan their upcoming nuptials, Lady Arabella determines not to give up without a fight. She manages to persuade Mary that marrying Frank would be a selfish act, and that if she truly loves him she should set him free. Meanwhile, Louis is drinking as much as his father ever did, while struggling with his unpopular position in society and Mary's rejection. A troubled and destructive young man, he takes great pleasure in insulting the Greshams when they invite him for dinner.
