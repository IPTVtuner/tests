Gareth and Rob's large new-build plot in Burton Latimer is boring and devoid of character. The couple wish to enjoy it with friends and their two beloved dogs. They also want to bring the sunshine into the plot with a Mediterranean theme and a sheltered spot for their hot tub. With a generous £8,000 budget, can Flo and Charlie add a southern European flavour to the space?
