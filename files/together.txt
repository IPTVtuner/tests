Together
Today, September 29
Joy recently moved to Chichester, where she has stunning sea views. But her garden is actually a small paved back yard where nothing grows. She would love a chic coastal-themed garden with hardy planting to survive the salty atmosphere and an entertaining area with seating. There's also an old shed that needs a revamp, and it's vital the view from her balcony looking down is as good as looking out to sea.
