Together
Today, November 01
James and Rox live in their dream Edwardian house in Roundhay, but their garden isn't working. It's open to the road, so not safe for their boys Jake and Ethan, and the couple loathe it. They want a family-friendly space that gives them an area to entertain and, more importantly, is fun for the kids. They also want to grow vegetables, and it's important that the garden encourages their two cats back outside.
