Together
Today, October 01
Lucy, Michael and their daughter Cherry live in Milton Keynes. They have a large but unsafe garden, and they have run out of ideas about how to change it. The couple dream of a safe family space that works for them and their beloved dogs. They are also keen to grow vegetables, so they want a zoned garden with a modern feel.
