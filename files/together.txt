Together
Today, November 20
It is election day, and while Sir Roger Scatcherd wins the respect of the voters, he succumbs to ill health at the hustings. Doctor Thorne does his best to ease the pain of the cantankerous old man, but he senses the end is near. Scatcherd's son Louis is called for and he takes an immediate shine to Mary, but Doctor Thorne is horrified to learn that Louis has romantic designs on his niece.
