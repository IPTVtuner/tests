Together
Today, August 14
Philip and Lorraine in Stockport have had their garden since 1987. Despite doing up their house, their garden remains untouched. With a budget of Â£4,750, they want to turn this unloved and forgotten space into a stately garden, with secret passageways, big urns, a tiled patio and lots of posh planting. Charlie Dimmock and the Rich brothers try to come up with designs that would not look out of place in a stately home. But who will come out on top?
