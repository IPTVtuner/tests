Together
Today, January 17
Ruth meets Cornelia Bayley, owner of Plas Teg, a Grade One listed Jacobean mansion that has remained virtually unchanged since it was built in 1610. For most of the 20th-century Plas Teg lay unforgotten and derelict with no roof, pigeons in residence and trees growing through the centre. However, in 1986 Cornelia fell in love with the building and purchased it for Â£75,000.
