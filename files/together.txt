Chesters is a Grade I listed Georgian home in the Scottish Borders. Built in 1790, Chesters is a 215-year-old Palladian style country house with 1,500 acres, a disused stable block and 14 estate cottages as well as a mile of the River Teviot. The house belongs to John Henderson, whose ancestors built the property two centuries ago, but John and his wife Ellie spend most of their time living hundreds of miles away.
