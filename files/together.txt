Together
Today, November 05
Karon Roberts and her partner Simon Sanders have quit the rat race to rear rare breed pigs in Suffolk. Simon inherited a 13-acre site from his farmer grandfather and wants to give something back to the village he grew up in. The couple have grand plans and expect to spend nearly a million pounds transforming their derelict land with pigs, vegetables and an enormous barn housing a farm shop, caf√© and art gallery.
