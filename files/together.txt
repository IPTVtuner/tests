Together
Today, April 04
Lauren and Jonathan first met when they starred in a production of Peter Pan together, and so they would like Charlie and Chris to reflect this theme in their design. The garden is long and bland, and despite having a budget of £3,000, the couple just don't know where to start. Both designers see the potential for lots of fun, and they set to work on creating gorgeous designs for the couple to choose from.
