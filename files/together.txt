Together
Today, December 24
Ruth Goodman and the team tackle the conditions faced by British farmers in late 1940, as the heavy bombing of the Blitz ravaged Britain's cities and drove millions to seek refuge in the countryside. Alex and Peter work in the freezing cold to turn inhabitable outbuildings into refugee shelters, aided by a 94-year-old conscientious objector who was conscripted as a labourer during the war due to his religious beliefs.
