Together
Today, April 06
Ben and Ruth need the help of the Garden Rescue team to transform their dated garden into something more chic. There's currently too much concrete and too many level changes for it to be safe for baby Eve. The couple are imagining a wild, natural garden with prairie-style planting and some opportunities for growing their own vegetables, and they also want to adopt some chickens from a rescue centre. Can Charlie and Lee come up with a design that ticks all the boxes for £2,500?
