Together
Today, October 08
It's the final week before the closure of Britain's last deep coal mine at Kellingley Colliery in North Yorkshire. Every miner at Kellingley will lose their job. We follow the story of Sheldon, Jonesy, Kev and Jack through the last few days of cutting, and down below ground as the last piece of coal is cut, and the machines are switched off for the very last time.
