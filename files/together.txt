Together
Today, November 06
Tony and Nayna love being outdoors, but their new build garden in Liverpool is uninspiring. It is just grass with some planting, and the couple have run out of ideas. They are hoping for a Caribbean theme with a modern twist, and Tony dreams of a centrepiece water feature. It must have a multi-functional pergola for entertaining and for Tony to use his punchbag. Also, they want plenty of tropical planting. With a budget of Â£4,500, can Charlie and Lee punch above their weight?
