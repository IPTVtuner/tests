The Garden Rescue team are in Wilmslow to transform Adam and Lauren's tired, boring and unsafe plot into a Chinese-inspired family space with a woodland twist. The new garden needs to remind Lauren of her happy years spent in China and Adam of his outdoor play as a child. For £7,000, Chris and Lee make their dreams come true.
