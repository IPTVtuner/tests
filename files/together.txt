Together
Today, August 11
As autumn ends, winter-proofing begins: essential work against cold and frost. The team stock up on animal feed, Peter builds pigsties, and Ruth tackles the laundry. The ram arrives on the farm to help produce lambs in the spring, and the team take delivery of a Shire horse. Plus, the farmers celebrate a traditional Victorian Christmas with the friends they've made over the first four months.
