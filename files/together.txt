Ruth Watson visits Tapeley Park, a sprawling stately home on the North Devon coast where the notorious eco-activist Hector Christie resides. This grand abode has been in the Christie family for 300 odd years. Until recently Hector was running Tapeley as a quasi-commune, but he has decided it's time to regain some control - so he has called on Ruth Watson to help turn the crumbling mansion's destiny around.
