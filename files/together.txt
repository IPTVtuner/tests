Kentchurch Court in Herefordshire has been home to the Scudamores for over 1,000 years; handed down through the family since 1058. When Jan Lucas-Scudamore first married into the family she imagined a life of luxury; but with annual running costs totaling Â£120,000 Kentchurch is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain. Ruth is impressed by the tight ship Jan runs and the beautiful and historic house and gardens.
