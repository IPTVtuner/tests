Two teams compete to build a mobile painting machine capable of decorating a house from a distance. The team's mechanical decorating devices will need to slap a top coat on the `Scrapheap' chalet, six metres high by seven metres wide. Accuracy is paramount, as they'll be penalised for any paint that strays over windows or doors.
