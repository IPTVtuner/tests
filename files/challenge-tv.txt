The National Motor Museum at Beaulieu is the setting for a unique motor racing event as 16 teams from around the country race home-built motorised furniture at breakneck speed around a specially designed course. Toilets take on dining tables and sofas go head to head with bath tubs as the great British bodging public compete for the right to take on the Scrapheap All Stars - `Scrapheap's' own house team.
