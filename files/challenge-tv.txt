The crowds descend on Blackpool's Imperial Hotel as the locals try to get the best price in town for their collectables. These include a selection of water colour prints of Salford and Liverpool, and a nice surprise for Blackpool resident Joyce Cooper who takes her late husband's watch collection to auction. The big deal of the day is a superb collection of autographs and photos including some Hollywood greats.
