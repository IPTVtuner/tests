In Darlington, Linda brings in two miniature pictures. Dealer David has his eye on them and makes an offer that would give Linda a 400 percent profit, but much to his dismay she turns him down! Can Linda really do any better at the auction? She seems confident, but the Duke isn't so sure, but when the pictures go under the hammer everyone is in for a surprise.
