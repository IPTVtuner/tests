Robert Llewellyn and Lisa Rogers present the first semi-final of the tenth series. Testing the teams' engineering capabilities to their limits, they are challenged to build super snow-shifting machines, and as well as having to race up a ten-degree slope in temperatures of minus four degrees, they also have to successfully clear the huge snowdrifts that stand between them and the finish line.
