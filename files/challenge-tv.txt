Challenge TV
Today, December 10
The Wroughton Classic Car and Bike Show is the setting for the first of the 2008 `Scrapheap' roadshows. The challenge is a head-to-head drag-racing duel with a twist: engines are banned. Sixteen teams have five weeks to build an array of crazy contraptions which will be pitted against each other in a series of knockout rounds. The fastest green speedster gets the chance to race against the Scrapheap Allstars.
