Today, March 31
It's the grand final of series 10. Series champions The Rusty Regiment and reigning `Scrapheap Champion of Champions' Woof Justice go head to head for the year's Rings of Steel trophy. The teams will be racing across land and water, but as it's the grand final this is no normal amphibious challenge. Engines are banned, so the teams will be relying on muscle power alone to move their manphibious craft.
