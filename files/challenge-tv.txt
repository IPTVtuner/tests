Today, March 17
This challenge was inspired by the incredible high-speed rocket sleds used by the US Air Force to test aircraft and spacecraft at supersonic speeds without taking to the air. The teams compete to build super-fast trains, but they're not allowed to send drive to the wheels. So, all the usual forms of drive such as chain and sprockets, belt drives and propshafts are effectively banned.
