Today, November 26
The two teams are challenged to build fire engines in just ten hours. They have to complete a tight course in the fastest possible time, extinguishing two burning mock-jet engines. The two teams of have-a-go heroes are Bristol model-makers the Super Models, and the Crash Bang Clan, three generations of the same family of Scottish car nuts. The teams are under expert scrutiny as they attempt to put out the fires.
