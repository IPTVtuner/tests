Robert Llewellyn and Lisa Rogers present the big one: the `Scrapheap Challenge' final. Woof Justice from Newcastle go head to head with the Beach Bums from Torquay. To get their hands on the `Scrapheap Challenge' Champions Cup, the finalists build high-powered swamp racers and must cross the Scrapheap swamp in four-wheeled vehicles as quickly as they can.
