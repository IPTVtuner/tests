Pauline brings in a netsuke and a watch and chain to show dealer Stuart Hofgartner. Stuart calls in fellow dealer Don Allison to look at the netsuke who dismisses it as of no real value. Stuart is interested in the watch and chain, but his offer isn't enough though to tempt Pauline, so she takes it to the auction. Her gamble pays off and she walks away with a big smile and a hefty wad of notes in her pocket.
