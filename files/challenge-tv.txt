Today, November 12
Backyard bodgers from across the country build crazy contraptions to compete in some of the heap's most madcap challenges to date. The first episode challenges the teams to break one of `Scrapheap's' longest standing records. Back in series six, The Catalysts set a top speed of 72mph in the Grand Prix Challenge. The Rocketeers and The Brum Brums are challenged to beat that time.
