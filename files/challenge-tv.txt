Two teams must build super-swift vehicles capable of racing up and over the `Scrapheap's' very own desert dunes. Sand is notoriously difficult to drive on as it's incredibly difficult to achieve grip, especially uphill. The two teams - the Happy Campers, a trio of camper van enthusiasts from Bridgewater, and the Dark Riders, a team of motorbike enthusiasts from Blackpool - are going to have to whip up a sand storm.
