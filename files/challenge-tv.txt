The Engine Eggheads - mechanical engineering students from London - take on The Diggers - a team of no-nonsense heavy plant engineers from Hull. The teams must scour the scrapheap for the parts they'll use to build monstrous motorised trikes. These terrifying three-wheelers will carry the entire team around a slalom course designed to test their trikes to the limit.
