Today, October 21
Vernon Kay presents the first in a new series of the celebrity game show in which two stars and their families compete to win big money for their chosen charities. In this edition, TV presenter Carol Vorderman and her family go up against astrologer Russell Grant and his clan. If the celebs are to bag the cash for their good causes, they must successfully second-guess the British public.
