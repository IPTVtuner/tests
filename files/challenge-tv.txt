In Darlington, Chris's wife paid just Â£3 for an antique teapot, and Chris wants to see its true value realised. Dealer David is reluctant to put too much of his cash on the table, so Chris takes the teapot to the auction to try and bring home the bacon for his wife. Will it be a huge mistake or a huge profit for Chris? The Duke is on hand to advise.
