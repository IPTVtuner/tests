Today, November 19
Five friends head off for a little post-exam R&R at a cabin in the woods. Their peace, and various attempted seductions, are interrupted by a hermit who staggers out of the forest covered in sores. He's obviously sick but the scared teens violently turn him away. Dying, he falls into a stream that provides their drinking water. As they fall prey to the virus, a grisly fight for survival begins.
