The stars of the Royal Ballet perform a very special selection of the best of ballet. From the ultra-contemporary `Untouchable' by Hofesh Schechter to the Hollywood glitz of `Carousel', there's something for everyone in this glorious gala. The stellar partnership of Marianela Nu√±ez and Vadim Muntagirov tackle one of the great classical pas de deux from `Don Quixote', and the larger forces of the whole company are seen in `Elite Syncopations'.
