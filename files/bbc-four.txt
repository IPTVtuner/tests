Walton-on-the-Naze in Essex is a traditional little seaside town. It's got a sandy beach and a pier and not much else. But despite the age of the jet and the cheap package tour, Walton's population still doubles during the season. This film reflects a typical day at the seaside with the visitors who have been coming here for years and the people whose job it is to entertain them and keep them happy.
