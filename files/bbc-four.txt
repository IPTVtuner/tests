First TV documentary about pop art sensation Pauline Boty, tracking the artist's original contribution to British art, her feminism and unique take on the nascent celebrity culture of the 1960s. Ahead of her time in so many ways, Boty's story ends with her tragic early death at 28 in 1966 and the subsequent revival of interest in her work in the last decade.
