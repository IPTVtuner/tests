Paul Rose's journey along the Pennine Way takes him to the Yorkshire Dales to the village of Malham, where the Pennine Way was launched fifty years ago. He hears from those who remember the opening ceremony before having a go at the limestone cliff face of Malham Cove. He also visits the sheep mart in Wensleydale - and enjoys a pint in Britain's highest pub.
