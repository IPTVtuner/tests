Twenty three senators of Rome's Republic, including Brutus and Cassius, murder Caesar to prevent his supposed aspirations as King of Rome. They go unpunished until Caesar's former legate, Mark Antony, speaks against them. The conspirators are forced to flee to the East, where they form an army. Antony raises his own army to fight them.
