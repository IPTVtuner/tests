When two sisters buy an apartment in the small Swedish town of Gullsp√•ng, they experience their own divine premonition. To their surprise, the seller is identical to their older sister who died by suicide 30 years earlier. What begins as an eerie story of family reunification soon becomes a Pandora's Box, as all three women's lives spiral out of control. A real-life Nordic mystery, the film takes the audience on a wild ride of unbelievable twists and turns.
