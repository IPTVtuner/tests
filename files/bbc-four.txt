A majestic presence, towering over Paris for more than 130 years, the Eiffel Tower is an iconic symbol of 19th-century progress and grandeur. Built for the 1889 Paris World's Fair, its creator, Gustave Eiffel, was at the height of his fame and ready to take on the dream of every engineer and architect, to build the world's tallest man-made structure. He had just two years, two months and five days to erect his 300-meter iron colossus.
