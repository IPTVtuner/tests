An amazing look at primates and their survival skills, from complex societies to tool use. Huge armies of Hamadryas baboons are seen battling on the plains of Ethiopia in order to steal females and settle old scores, Japanese macaques beat the cold by lounging in thermal springs - but only if they come from the right family, and an orang-utan baby fails in its struggle to make an umbrella out of leaves to keep off the rain.
