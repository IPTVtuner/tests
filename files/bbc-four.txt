Melvyn Bragg is at Osterley Park in Middlesex, the site of the first Home Guard training school. Melvyn looks back to the Second World War and a time when millions of ordinary men were prepared to die for their country as Home Guard recruits. Plus, the creator of `Dad's Army', Jimmy Perry, tells us why he signed up to the Home Guard and Ken Chambers shares his own extraordinary stories from his own experience.
