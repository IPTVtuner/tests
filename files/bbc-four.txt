For over six decades Sir Ken Dodd was one of Britain's favourite entertainers, a comedian whose surreal world of tickling sticks, jam butty mines and Diddymen kept generations of audiences entertained from his professional debut in 1954 to his final curtain call in December 2017. In Sir Ken's own words and with testimony from friends, family and colleagues who knew him best, this revealing documentary film tells the story of his incredible life and long career.
