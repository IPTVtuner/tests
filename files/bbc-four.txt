Before the war in Ukraine, Mariupol was a thriving city, home to 430,000 people. In a little under three months, most of its citizens fled Putin's army and thousands were killed. Filmed and told by residents, this is the story of their loss, bravery, determination and incredible daring in escape. They were among those who sought refuge in the Mariupol Theatre, only for it to be bombed, the maternity hospital which was also hit, and the Azovstal steelworks.
