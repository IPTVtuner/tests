Join Grace Dent on a televisual trip of a lifetime as she explores the sights, sounds and schedules of the great British summer. Grace's epic journey covers everything that informs attitudes to summertime, from the travel shows of the 60s and 70s, which first brought the world's finest resorts into our living rooms, to Del and Rodney Trotter fooling about abroad and the high jinks of `Hi-de-Hi!'
