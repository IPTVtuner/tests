From tropical rainforest to the Great Barrier Reef, Michael Portillo navigates his way by rail through Queensland, Australia, with the aid of his 1913 Bradshaw's Guide. Inching his way across the Stony Creek Bridge on the Kuranda Scenic Railway, he marvels at the engineering expertise of the 1890s, when the line was built, and the magnificent scenery 300 metres below him.
