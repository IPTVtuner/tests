Sir Simon Rattle makes an emotional appearance at the Proms at the helm of the London Symphony Orchestra. In a deeply personal programme, Sir Simon and the orchestra perform Mahler's mighty Second Symphony, `Resurrection', a musical odyssey on an epic scale, to a sellout crowd at the Royal Albert Hall. The work has been indelibly linked with Sir Simon since he first rose to prominence as a student conductor when he was just a teenager.
