John visits a couple in Gunner, near Salisbury, who wanted to build a garage next to their bungalow but did not realise they were living by a fifth-century graveyard. The programme follows a team of archaeologists as they excavate off the skeleton of a 30-year-old man, attempting to resolve whether he was a Saxon or a native Briton.
