Ray Mears goes on an epic adventure into Canada's unforgiving yet inspiring landscape. Until David Thompson found a route through the Rockies, the west coast was effectively cut off from the rest of Canada. The unique cultures, skills and landscape of Canada's far west make it a rich and diverse place. Ray explores its bushcraft, nature and traditions as he completes his journey across Canada.
