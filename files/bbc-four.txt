In a programme first broadcast in 1980, Arena looks at writer and performer Victoria Wood and explores her talent to amuse through her witty and engaging songs. The film also profiles (then) teenage playwright Andrea Dunbar, whose first play, The Arbor, written when she was only 15, was running at the Royal Court.
