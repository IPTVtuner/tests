Fred's fascinating journey through Britain's industrial past sees him tracing the development of the railways, from the first steam locomotive to the record-breaking Mallard. The excitement reminds him of his childhood days when locomotives used to roar past his bedroom window, and Fred gets his hands dirty stoking the boiler of a Black Five as he speeds through the Welsh countryside.
