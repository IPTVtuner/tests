TV legend Michael Parkinson interviews snooker icon Ray Reardon, who discusses going down the mines at an early age and learning to play snooker at Tredegar Mineworkers' Institute. He also opens up about the frightening event that saw him buried underground for three hours, and how he remained calm by playing thousands of games of marbles with his brother in his mind.
