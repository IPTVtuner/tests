Documentary about Jane Goodall, a young secretary from Bournemouth with no scientific qualifications, who entered a remote forest in Africa in 1960 and became accepted by a group of wild chimpanzees. Her discoveries transformed our understanding of them and challenged the way we define ourselves as human beings by showing just how close we are as a species to our closest living relatives.
