BBC Four
Today, January 26
A look back at some of the songs performed on the show in 1993. Dance music and Euro pop continued to dominate the charts with performances from Haddaway, Sub Sub, Ace of Base and Robin S. The early stages of Britpop began to emerge with Suede and Radiohead plus Icelandic superstar Bj√∂rk makes an early appearance. Then there are the big sellers from Meat Loaf and Gabrielle and the grooves came courtesy of Jamiroquai and Chaka Demus & Pliers plus many more.
