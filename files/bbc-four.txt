Thirty years ago, thousands of portraits from a small studio in Bradford were saved from a skip. They're a unique collection of photographs which record the changing face of a British industrial city in the middle of the 20th century. Many of the people in the portraits were new arrivals from the Asian subcontinent, eastern Europe and the Caribbean, attracted by the offer of work in wool mills. The names of these people are a mystery, only their faces survive.
