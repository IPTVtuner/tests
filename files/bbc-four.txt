1984 sees Top of the Pops at the height of its 80s' pomp - the year of big hair and big tunes. A BBC ban on Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Relax in January leads to an embarrassing Frankie-shaped hole on the show when it reaches No 1. One of the sounds of 1984 is Hi-NRG, that goes overground from the gay club scene into the mainstream charts. 1984 sees the rise of the one-man acts such as Nik Kershaw and Howard Jones.
