In this exclusive interview from 1993, Robert Redford talks to Barry Norman about his dislike of acting, his looks, his support for independent film-makers through his Sundance Institute and his latest film, A River Runs through It. Known for his wish for privacy and concern for the environment, Redford shuns the glamour of the West Coast to live in Utah. So how does he view the film community in Hollywood? And will he ever team up on screen with Paul Newman again?
