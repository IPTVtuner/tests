Peter Egan looks back on the BBC's 1987 adaptation of John le Carre's A Perfect Spy, one of the writer's most acclaimed novels, dramatised a year after the book's publication. Egan starred as British intelligence officer and double agent Magnus Pym, in a role that was a departure from the comedies he was best known for.
