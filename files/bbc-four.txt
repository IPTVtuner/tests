This film for Omnibus follows the two weeks of rehearsal that led up to the recording of a Morecambe and Wise Show that aired on 16 February 1973. 'Fools Rush In' was Eric and Ernie's billing in their early days. Thirty years later, they had become Britain's best-known comedians, with regular audiences of nearly 20 million people. Producer John Ammonds, writer Eddie Braben, as well as Eric and Ernie talk about the skill and sheer hard work of comedy.
