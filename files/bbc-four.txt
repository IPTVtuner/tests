In a special episode, Dame Judi Dench reveals her love of the countryside - and Scotland in particular. From picnics to camping, saving the arts in rural communities and a lifelong passion for wildlife, the legend of stage and screen joins Charlotte Smith in the grounds of Inveraray Castle to reflect on the impact the countryside has had on her and her family. Dame Judi is a talented watercolourist, inspired by the Scottish landscape.
