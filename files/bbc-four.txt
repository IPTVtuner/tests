Today, January 19
As the 1980's draw to a close, Top of the Pops remains a broad church. We celebrate 1988 by cherry-picking the cream of the crop. The programme includes stand-out hits from Yazz, S'Express and Bomb the Bass, representing the growing popularity of house music, new Australian pop royalty Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan, who ruled the charts along with teen stars Bros and Tiffany, soul legends Womack and Womack, the Irish mist of Enya and British reggae from Maxi Priest.
