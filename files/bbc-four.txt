Franz Leh√°r's laugh-out-loud operetta, The Merry Widow, is a work of pure theatrical pleasure: a cocktail of ravishing music, touching romance and madcap comedy. Glyndebourne's lavish new staging from award-winning West End director Cal McCrystal boasts all the opulence of classic Hollywood and stars Danielle de Niese as the glamorous, wealthy widow Hanna on a search for true love.
