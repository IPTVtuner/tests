After the failure of the plot to blow Adolf Hitler to pieces as he studied his campaigns in the Wolf's Lair on 20 July 1944, the conspirators were rounded up, put on trial and hanged. To savour his revenge at leisure, Hitler ordered the trials and death throes of his enemies to be filmed. Four hours of Hitler's film have been tracked down, and from it emerges a unique and bizarre parody of justice, as the traitors to the Third Reich are hounded to their death.
