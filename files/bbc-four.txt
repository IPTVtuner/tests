The team are on the hunt for archaeology from the more recent past as they follow the search for artefacts from World War II. They join marine archaeologists in the Solent as they raise the once-in-a-lifetime find of a Fairey Barracuda divebomber. More than 2,500 Barracudas were in service during the war but not a single complete plane survives today. Nao√≠se Mac Sweeney joins the post excavation to reveal how the find could help bring this rare aircraft back to life.
