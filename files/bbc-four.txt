Looking at the Roman empire from the bottom up. Professor Mary Beard asks not what the Romans did for us, but what the Empire did for Rome? Mary rides the via Appia, climbs up to the top seats of the collosseum, takes a boat ride to Ostia and journeys into the bowels of Monte Testaccio. She traces the story of some extraordinary Romans, including an eccentric baker who made a fortune from the grain trade.
