Psychotherapist Philippa Perry time-travels back to the 1890's to explore how the late Victorian passion for science co-exists with a deeply held belief in the paranormal. Using a collection of rare and restored Victorian films from the BFI National Archive, she shows how the latest media innovations made use of contemporary ideas of ghosts and the afterlife, and how this `new media' anticipated today's networked world.
