Today, November 11
Celebrating the singing career of Agnetha Fältskog, which began in the mid-60s when she was just 15. Within just two years, she was a singing sensation at the top of the charts in Sweden, before meeting husband Björn Ulvaeus and becoming a part of pop group ABBA in the 70s. Agnetha lacked confidence on stage as the global demand for the group grew and grew, while being away from her children caused great turmoil.
