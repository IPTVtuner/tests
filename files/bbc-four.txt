In this film essay, the writer and broadcaster Joan Bakewell considers how great creative artists respond to old age. For many, it's not a period of waning powers, but a move into an era of renewed creativity. 'Late work' can be full of renewed vision and achievement. Examining the work of some of today's most distinguished artists, and investigating current scientific theories about the ageing process, Joan discovers that for many artists, it doesn't have to be downhill all the way.
