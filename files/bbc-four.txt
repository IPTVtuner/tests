BBC Four
Today, January 06
Following BBC Four's `Top of the Pops 1976', the next stop is 1977 - in some ways a year zero for Britain's most iconic music programme. As the country veered between strikes and street parties, pop bastion `Top of the Pops' was stormed by punk and new wave acts such as the Stranglers and the Jam. Disco was also a dominant force.
