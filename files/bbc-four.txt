Stopping at Saxmundham in Suffolk, Michael heads for Snape Maltings, a concert and arts venue, and learns how the music and life of one of Britain's greatest composers was shaped by the sea and his Suffolk surroundings. Striking north, Michael's next stop is the Norfolk seaside resort of Great Yarmouth.
