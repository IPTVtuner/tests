A coastal walk is the setting for the Poet Laureate's ramble along Yorkshire's enchanting and historic frontier with the North Sea. Starting in Ravenscar, Simon Armitage takes the old `Cinder Track', a disused railway line. Carrying a 360-degree camera, he passes former quarries and brickworks, before taking a beach walk from Boggle Hole to the picture-perfect Robin Hood's Bay. Simon witnesses at first-hand the impact of coastal erosion, and meets farmers and locals.
