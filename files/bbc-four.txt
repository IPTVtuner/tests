Documentary showing the painter Jack Vettriano at work in his studio. Vettriano is arguably Britain's most popular artist, with his nostalgic paintings of a lost age of glamour being instantly recognisable and his most famous work, `The Singing Butler' (which he copied from a guide to illustration), the country's bestselling image, reproduced on everything from calendars to jigsaws.
