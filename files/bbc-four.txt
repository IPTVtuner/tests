The 1980s was an era in which a fusillade of new genres emerged, and many are still here today, such as hip-hop and house. Dylan Jones has mined the archives to select some of the most crucial tracks in the rise of these two genres. From a young Kurtis Blow making his `Top of the Pops' debut to the sonic bombardment of Public Enemy and the sampling skills of Bomb the Bass, this is a showcase of the evolution in rap and house music across the decade.
