This month, The Sky at Night has a spooky twist. Across the universe, there are hidden objects that we can't see, but astronomers and scientists still believe they're out there. To find out how we know that these mysterious objects exist, the team are going ghost hunting. Cosmic ghost hunting. Prof Chris Lintott and Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock are at Provan Hall, one of the oldest buildings in Glasgow and the site of several supposed ghost sightings across its 550-year history.
