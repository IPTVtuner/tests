Andrew Lloyd Webber has reigned over musical theatre for nearly five decades and has delighted millions worldwide with hit shows like `Jesus Christ Superstar', `Evita', `Cats', `The Phantom of the Opera', `Aspects of Love' and most recently `School of Rock The Musical'. To mark his 70th year, Lloyd Webber has written an autobiography called `Unmasked', a candid and confessional account of his early life and career up to the opening of `Phantom'.
