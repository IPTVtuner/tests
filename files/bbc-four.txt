In August 1971, football teams from England, Argentina, Mexico, France, Denmark, and Italy gathered in Mexico City for a watershed tournament. With lavish sponsorship, extensive TV coverage, merchandise on every street corner and over 100,000 roaring fans at the historic Estadio Azteca, media outlets treated the players like rock stars. Despite being one of the most groundbreaking moments in footballing history, most people have never heard of it because the players were all women.
