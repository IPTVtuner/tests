Intimate portrait of Sir John Betjeman, the UK's poet laureate from 1972 until his death in 1984 and one of the most popular English poets of the 20th century. Betjeman's life was full of contrasts. He entertained the world with his warmth and enthusiasm, but, inwardly, he was haunted by fear, religious doubt, remorse and guilt. Highlighting his achievements as a conservationist and broadcaster, the film features contributions from the Prince of Wales and Lord Snowdon.
