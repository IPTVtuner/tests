Concert which recalls the heady days of the 1960s folk revival, centring upon the singer-songwriter talents to emerge from the clubs of New York's Greenwich Village and beyond. Hosted by singer-songwriter Billy Bragg, it features Village originals Judy Collins, Roger McGuinn, Eric Andersen and Carolyn Hester, performing songs from their own repertoire and from their contemporaries who contributed to such an extraordinary songbook.
