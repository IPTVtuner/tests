Autumn 1988. Christine, a hairdresser in the small north eastern town of Mauberge in France, is violently sexually assaulted on her way to work early one morning. Regaining consciousness and comforted by her sister, she bravely attends her local police station to report the incident. A powerful drama series based on the real events of an almost 30-year failure of police to identify a serial rapist whose crimes spanned decades. In French with English subtitles.
