Historian Simon Sebag Montefiore uncovers the central role played by religion in creating and maintaining the power of the city of Rome from its foundations to the modern day. In the first episode we see how every event in ancient Rome revolved around religion. From the foundation myth through to the deification of Emperors; nothing could happen without calling upon the Pantheon of Roman gods.
