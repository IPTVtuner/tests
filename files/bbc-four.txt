In March 2018 an international team of scientists gathered in a remote valley in the Canadian Rockies to conduct a unique experiment, to attempt to see into the heart of a massive avalanche to see if we can find ways to save lives in the future. Set in truly spectacular scenery, this experiment is not just visually stunning, it is truly groundbreaking. Avalanches kill hundreds of people every year.
