Alison Steadman looks back at Dennis Potter's `The Singing Detective', once described by Stephen King as `television's Citizen Kane'. From memories of happy times working with leading man Michael Gambon, and the pride of being involved in a piece that got the whole nation talking, to the stresses of being caught up in the controversy surrounding her character's notorious outdoor sex scene, Alison brings her unique perspective to a series she ranks amongst her favourites.
