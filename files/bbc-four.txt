Dame Beryl Bainbridge takes an idiosyncratic tour of the last 20 years of writer and poet Samuel Johnson's turbulent life. During this period, Johnson was the house guest of Henry Thrale, the richest brewer in England, and his wife Hester, who cared for him throughout his bouts of melancholia and gout. Bainbridge has taken the story of their relationship for her novel According to Queeney.
