When DCI Barbara Kramer and her colleague Thomas Riedle get the message that a young woman from Buchingen has not returned home from a run, the local force and concerned villagers have already been searching for her for 17 hours. They face an uphill struggle to prevent evidence from being destroyed, a contingency which becomes more salient when a body is discovered 72 hours later. In German with English subtitles.
