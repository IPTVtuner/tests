A Storyville documentary that tells the untold story of a seemingly ordinary Englishman who spent more than 40 years as a mercenary, fighting other people's wars for money. Basingstoke-based Dave Tompkins was a petty thief who craved adventure. His career as an international mercenary began in Africa and took him all over the world - to Afghanistan, Croatia and later to Colombia, where he led a team commissioned to assassinate notorious Columbian drug lord Pablo Escobar.
