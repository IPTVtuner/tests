Konnie Huq celebrates the very best of British children's television, with a dazzling array of clips from some of the most treasured programmes ever made and revealing chats with some of TV's most beloved stars. But Konnie also tells a perhaps more surprising story: of how kids' TV has frequently been at the forefront of social change, in terms of the stories it tells and the people who get to tell them.
