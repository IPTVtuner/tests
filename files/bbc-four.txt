The 1890's was the decade when science, entertainment, art and morality collide, and the Victorians have to make sense of it all. Actor Paul McGann discovers how the works of HG Wells, Aubrey Beardsley and Oscar Wilde were shaped by fears of moral, social and racial degeneration. Paul, seated in Wells's Time Machine, sees how the author's prophecies of a future in which humanity has decayed and degenerated highlighted the fears of the British Empire.
