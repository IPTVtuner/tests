Born to an Indian mother and a Nepalese father, in the Indian Himalayan village where he lives, he is taunted for being mixed race. This Storyville documentary follows the little boy over five transformative years as he grapples with the profound effects of racism, never retaliating, finally triumphing when he discovers a talent for a sport that turns his 'enemies' into his teammates.
