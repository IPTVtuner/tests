A look at how reptiles and amphibians conquer their shortcomings through amazing innovation. Extreme slow-motion shows how a Jesus Christ lizard runs on water, and how a chameleon fires an extendible tongue at its prey with unfailing accuracy. The camera also follows a Niuean sea snake, which avoids predators by swimming to an air bubble at the end of an underwater tunnel, and later Komodo dragons hunt a huge water-buffalo.
