Steve Backshall heads a team descending into the crater of a giant extinct volcano located in the jungle of New Guinea. Steve and wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan discover two new species of mammal: a giant rat that is as big as a cat, and a cuscus, which is a tree-climbing marsupial. George McGavin travels east to an erupting volcano and discovers a rare bird that depends on the hot ash for its survival.
