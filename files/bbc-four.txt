Today, September 08
A celebration of some of the most exciting new classical music premiered in the Royal Albert Hall this summer chosen by Tom Service, presenter of Radio 3's New Music Show, with interviews with their composers. From cutting-edge electronics, music for massed choirs and orchestral instruments as you've never heard them before, this whistlestop tour takes in the best of the best of contemporary commissions heard for the very first time at the Proms this year.
