In 1996, young investigating judge Irene Dereux realises that a case she has been assigned has striking similarities with others. She doggedly attempts to persuade the police that they have a serial rapist on their hands, and that a thorough investigation is imperative if they are to prevent more women from being assaulted. In French with English subtitles.
