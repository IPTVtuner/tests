Twenty-five years ago the Penlee lifeboat was called out to help a stricken coaster off the coast of Cornwall. In hurricane winds and sixty foot waves the crew of the Solomon Browne made a heroic attempt to rescue those on board the ill-fated Union Star. Using actual radio footage, eye-witness testimony and memories of bereaved family members, this documentary tells the story of that tragic night.
