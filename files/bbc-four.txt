It's Christmas Eve, and at the Goods' house, Tom and Barbara are making decorations and crackers ready for Christmas Day, while at the Leadbetters, Margo has sent back her whole order because her Christmas tree is six and a quarter inches too short. However, when the company does not deliver her order the following day, she and Jerry are left with no decorations, food or drink. Can there be anything worse?
