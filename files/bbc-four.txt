Magic and mischief at the Proms as Sir Mark Elder and the Hall√© Orchestra bring Dukas's much-loved The Sorcerer's Apprentice, to kick-start an evening of highly visual music. Drama is the main event, with Puccini's opera Il Tabarro, a tale of lust, adultery and murder set on the Seine in Paris. Amidst the mayhem, Respighi's stunning aural portrait Fountains of Rome provides a moment of calm. Join presenter Petroc Trelawny and special guests for this feast for the senses.
