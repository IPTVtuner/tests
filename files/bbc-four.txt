Writer and naturalist Helen Macdonald traces the dramatic journey of Britain?s greatest river, the Tay, over an entire year. Mixing natural history, cutting-edge science and historical biography with a spectacular travelogue, the film is a celebration of our largest river as it transforms from melting Highland snow to a vast torrent flowing into the cold North Sea. Following the river?s course from Ben Lui in the west to Dundee in the east, Helen explores the Tay?s magical landscapes.
