Famous for waking up the nation on Radio One and his afternoon drive-time show, DJ and presenter Nick Grimshaw heads to the north east of England for a stroll through a fascinating landscape. Exploring historic areas of Warkworth and Amble in Northumberland, Nick begins his walk at first light, dipping his toes in the sea for a refreshing wake-me-up along the beach. Crossing sand dunes and an ancient river, Nick heads for the streets of Warkworth and reflects on the importance of family life, including the positive influence of his late father. Nick talks about recognising his sexuality as he was growing up - including questioning what 'being gay' would actually mean. Taking the short boat crossing to the extraordinary Warkworth Hermitage - a retreat carved from a sandstone cliff - Nick talks about the benefits meditation has brought to his life. As Nick approaches the end of his walk, the conversation turns to the future.
