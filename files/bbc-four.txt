Julia Bradbury follows in the footsteps of guidebook writer Alfred Wainwright by walking across northern England from west to east coast. Over three mountain ranges and across three valleys, the second stage of Julia's journey is a grand traverse of Wainwright's much-loved Lake District. Having shrugged off the rain, Julia ends with the epic 17-mile final day in the Lakes.
