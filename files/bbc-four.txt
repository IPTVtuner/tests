Monty Don continues his journey with a visit to the richest and most powerful nation in the world: the United States of America. There, he meets garden guerrillas in New York, visits a Virginian garden that reflects the birth of the nation, and finally travels west to California, to see if gardens there reflect more than the glitz of the movie industry.
