The incredible true story of a man who lived for 15 months trapped inside a small room, naked, starving and alone... completely unaware that his life was being broadcast on national TV to over 17 million viewers a week. The Contestant traces the experience of aspiring comedian Tomoaki Hamatsu, nicknamed Nasubi, who, in 1998, thought he was going to an audition, when a Japanese TV producer enlisted him to take part in a challenge.
