This rare and revealing documentary from 1996 about artist Sarah Lucas is being shown to coincide with Lucas's retrospective at London's Whitechapel Gallery. Made by acclaimed director Vanessa Engle, the film shadows Lucas over four months, as she makes her witty and provocative sculptures, often using everyday objects. Candid and often hilarious contributions from Angus Fairhurst, Gary Hume, Damien Hirst, Jay Jopling and Barbara Gladstone.
