British artists Gilbert and George have fascinated, outraged, delighted and confounded the art establishment. Since their first appearance as `living sculptures' in the late 1960s, their work has persistently taken a provocative, often uncomfortable look at both their own lives and the life of the city that continues to inspire their art, London. Alan is invited into their East End home, where the couple have lived together for four decades.
