Actors Amanda Root and Sophie Thompson look back on their roles in the BBC's 1995 adaptation of Jane Austen's Persuasion, a story of missed opportunities and lost love. The pair discuss how this bold adaptation was filmed in a naturalistic style, with minimal lighting and hardly any make-up, a fitting approach to a novel that was itself ahead of its time.
