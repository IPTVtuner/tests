Michael Portillo is in Cornwall's county town, Truro, with his 1930s Bradshaw's Guide. In the surrounding countryside, he finds the historic estate of Trewithen, whose gardens were stocked from China by professional plant hunters commissioned by its owner. The Atlantic Coast branch line carries Michael north to Newquay.
