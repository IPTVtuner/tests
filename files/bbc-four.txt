BBC Four
Today, December 22
Welcome to this celebration of big hits performed at Top of the Pops on or close to the Christmas show on suitably seasonal sets. 'Tis the season to be jolly and it's not only actual Christmas-themed hits that recall the ghost of Christmases past but all the songs we bought and loved in Decembers past.
