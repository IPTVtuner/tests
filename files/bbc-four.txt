Sir Simon Schama looks back on his 2006 series The Power of Art, which examined the works of eight artists and explored the question 'How powerful is art, can it change your life?'. It was a forensic study not of an artist's life, but of a moment in that life. A piece of work that was an unexpected triumph, or catastrophe. A look at the world in which that work was created and going back in time to explore what lead the artist to that moment.
