Stopping at Dundee, Michael heads for Glamis Castle, where Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the Queen Mother grew up. Michael hears about her happy childhood and how she later found sanctuary there, when King Edward VIII abdicated and she and Prince Albert unexpectedly became King and Queen of the United Kingdom. Striking north along the east coast of Scotland Michael's next stop is Montrose from where he makes an excursion into the Eastern Highlands.
