Jules Hudson heads to Snowdonia with a buyer who wants to downsize and move closer to relatives. For her Â£350,000 budget and her son in tow for support, she would like her new rural property to come with small business potential. Away from the house hunt, Jules joins one dedicated man and his dog to learn about life as a shepherd in this region's wild protected landscape.
