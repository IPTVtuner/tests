Jonnie Irwin is rural property hunting in Argyll and Bute with a couple from Ayr who want to invest their Â£350,000 budget in a property with priceless countryside views. While in the region, Jonnie heads to the shores of Loch Fyne and visits Inveraray Castle, one of Scotland's finest stately homes and ancestral seat of the Dukes of Argyll for the past three hundred years.
