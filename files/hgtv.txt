Former childhood sweethearts Chris Kelly and Sue Hindle have a dream of uniting their two families under one roof. With this in mind, they fall in love with a tiny cruck-framed field house and plan to convert it into their first home together, but with four teenage daughters to house, they will need to get planning permission for a crucial extension to make this dream a reality. George Clarke is called upon to help.
