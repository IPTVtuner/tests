Alan Titchmarsh and team visit Hull to transform the garden of Macmillan nurse Maggie Simkiss, who cares for patients at the end of their lives, treating their emotional wellbeing as well as their medical needs. Even if someone has been diagnosed with just hours to live, Maggie says there is a great deal she can do to make their final hours worthwhile and happy. Outside work she is equally devoted to charities and also looks after her grandchildren, so her garden has been neglected.
