In the fourth series of this competition, renowned interior designer Kelly Hoppen MBE joins Daniel Hopwood on the judging panel as a new crop of amateur interior designers try their best to win the title. The hopefuls complete a series of home renovation challenges in knockout rounds; of those eliminated the judges choose one wildcard option to continue in the contest. Tasks involve transforming three similar rooms in three similar neighbouring properties following a brief from the owners. The contestants vie in heats of three in the opening round, with the winners progressing through to the final. Architectural historian Tom Dyckhoff is the show's presenter.
