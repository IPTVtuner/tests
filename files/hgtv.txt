`The Great Pottery Throw Down' returns to Stoke-on-Trent for a second season of the competition. Ten contestants are selected to participate from a group of home potters who aspire to make it as a top potter. Each episode shows footage filmed over a four-day period, during which the amateur potters are given a series of assignments to complete. Industry experts Kate Malone and Keith Brymer Jones judge the finished pieces while Sara Cox presents. Challenges include the Spot Test, which aims to assess technical abilities and the Throw Down, where timing is everything.
