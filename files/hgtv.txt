Accountants Mimi and Luke have lived in their terraced house in Grantham for five years with their daughter, and Mimi's son. With Luke's two older children often there also, it's bursting at the seams, yet the layout is entirely unpractical. They fell in love with the home because of its large garden, however the living areas are a rabbit warren of small disjointed rooms.
