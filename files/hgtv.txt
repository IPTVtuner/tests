Aled Jones heads to Dorset to help a house-hunting couple, with a substantial Â£700,000 budget, move back to the county where they first fell in love. Away from the house hunt, Aled takes a ride in an armoured tank, as he discovers Dorset's remarkable historic links to this British military invention.
