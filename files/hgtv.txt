Reclamation master Jay Blades is at Walsall recycling centre in search of three items he can rework to reveal their true potential. Designers Josh and Oli give two metal gates a radical redesign, while Bristol-based upholsterer Leigh-Anne attempts to give a set of mid-century chairs a stylish overhaul. For his own project, Jay has two tables to transform, but will he succeed in turning tired items into a pocketful of profit?
