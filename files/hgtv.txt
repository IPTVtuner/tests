Jules Hudson is helping a retired couple who have decided to escape town life after over 40 years in the same property, and with their Â£450,000 budget, buy a rural retreat in West Wales with space for their ponies. While in Pembrokeshire, Jules visits Lammas, Britain's first eco-village, and admires the impressive results of families who have self- built their homes and are pioneering a sustainable life in the country.
