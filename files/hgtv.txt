Upcycling aficionado Sarah Moore is rummaging the rubbish at Wallyford Recycling Centre in East Lothian in the hope of finding hidden gems to transform. With three items saved, Sarah turns to designer Sarah Peterson to make over a tired trolley, while upcycler Rupert Blanchard gets creative with a telephone table. For her own project, Sarah attempts to transform a nest of tables, but will she and her team succeed in turning the items from old to sold?
