In the third series, a new crop of amateur interior designers try to impress judges Sophie Robinson and Daniel Hopwood enough to win the competition that sees more than 20 hopefuls doing their best to successfully complete a series of challenges. They involve transforming three similar rooms in three similar neighbouring properties following a brief from the owners. The contestants vie in heats of three in the opening round, with the winners progressessing through the competition until just three compete in the final to be named winner. Architectural historian Tom Dyckhoff is the show's presenter.
