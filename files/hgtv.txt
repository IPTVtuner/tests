Nicki Chapman is in rural Gloucestershire helping an intrepid aunt and niece with a budget of Â£600,000 find a country home for two generations, that could also furnish them with an income. Along the way, Nicki heads to Owlpen Manor and hears the story of how this Cotswold Tudor building was rescued from its `sleeping beauty' state after a hundred years of disrepair, and restored by the family who now call it home.
