After tying the knot last year, a super active and self-employed couple now desire a new rural backdrop for their married life and business. Jules Hudson is helping them find that base in the Welsh Borders, with a budget of Â£365k. Whilst in the region, Jules also visits a timber-frame manufacturer in Herefordshire who is keeping alive the tradition of heritage properties associated with the area.
