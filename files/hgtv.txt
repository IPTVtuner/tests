Upcycling supremo Sarah Moore scours the skips at Witley Recycling Centre in Surrey, hoping to find three unwanted items she can restore, rejuvenate and sell on for a profit. Assisting Sarah in her mission are trusty artisans Neil Wragg and Simion Hawtin-Smith. A pair of leather wallets are given a magic makeover by bag maker Neil, while upholsterer Simion has the task of transforming a rocking chair. A collection of oak off-cuts will be given the upcycling once-over by Sarah.
