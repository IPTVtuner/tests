Sonali Shah heads to the Norfolk countryside with a couple planning to buy their first home together, who have high hopes that their Â£375,000 budget will afford them a character property close to the coast where they can enjoy semi-retirement. Away from the search, Sonali scales the heights of Happisburgh lighthouse and discovers the illuminating past and inner workings of East Anglia's oldest working lighthouse.
