Alan Titchmarsh and the team present the makeover show, transforming unloved spaces into dream gardens for some very special people. In this episode, they visit Moorland in Somerset - an area which was devastated by the floods of 2014. There they surprise a couple whose lives - and garden - were turned upside down by the disaster. Sheila Colquhoun and her husband Alex were looking forward to retirement that year, but instead it turned out to be one of the worst in their lives.
