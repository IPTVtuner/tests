Margherita Taylor is journeying through the countryside of the East Midlands with a couple who want to invest their Â£650,000 budget in a character property with space for their young family and gives them a balance between leading `the good life' and nearby train connections back to London for work. Along the way, Margherita visits a Leicestershire dairy farm, where a husband and wife duo have diversified and revived a three hundred-year-old recipe for the region's cheese, Red Leicester.
