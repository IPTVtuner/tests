Alan Titchmarsh and his team come to the aid of Carol Nwosu, who has to care for her son Danny - who has sickle cell anaemia - while coping with her own crippling arthritis. In spite of this, Carol dedicates her time to running a charity that supports families whose children have sickle cell disease.
