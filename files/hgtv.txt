Upcycler Jay Blades is at Altrincham Recycling Centre on a mission to rescue and revive unwanted items. With three eclectic skip-finds to transform, Jay turns to quirky clockmaker Paul Parry to update an old radio while designer maker Sarah Peterson is tasked with transforming aside table and chest of drawers. Jay takes on four dining chairs as his own creative project.
