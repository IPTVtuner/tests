Presented by Joe Lycett, `The Great British Sewing Bee' returns with a group of new home sewers who will battle it out in the sewing room to reach the final. The sewers are presided over by judges and industry professionals, designer Patrick Grant of Savile Row and Central St Martin's Esme Young. Each week contestants are set three sewing challenges, on which they will be judged on personal style as well as technique. The best performers get through each week while those at the bottom are eliminated from the competition.
