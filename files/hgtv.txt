Jules Hudson is on a house-hunting mission in the Somerset countryside with a keen gardening couple who have Â£700,000 pounds, and high hopes of enjoying the county's mild climate. Away from the property search, Jules meets Sally Tuffin, former London fashion designer turned acclaimed ceramics artist, and in her studio, sees how her creative work is inspired by her rural Somerset surroundings.
