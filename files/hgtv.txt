Alistair Appleton is in the New Forest helping a recently retired couple with a Â£1 million budget and a passion for beekeeping leave suburban life behind and buy a country home close to family. Whilst in the area, Alistair meets one of the specially appointed Crown Keepers, who help manage the 10,000 acres of protected forest, along with herds of fallow deer which Alistair is lucky enough to see.
