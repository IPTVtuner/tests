Today's house hunt is in North Wales where Jules Hudson is helping a pair of returning expats find their ideal country home for a budget of Â£350,000. Whilst in the region, Jules heads out with a local fisherman to gather wild mussels using an ancient method that's been used on Wales' northern coast for 200 years.
