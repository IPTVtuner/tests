Alan Titchmarsh presents the garden makeover show, transforming neglected spaces for some very special people. Alan and the team are in Dorset creating a garden for a young family coping with terminal illness. Student Rachel is 27 and met 29-year-old Dorset farm worker Andrew while out clubbing six years ago, and they became an item instantly. The couple were planning their future when Andrew was diagnosed with bowel cancer.
