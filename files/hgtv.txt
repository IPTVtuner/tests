Alan Titchmarsh presents the garden makeover show, transforming unloved spaces for some very special people. Alan and the team are in the sleepy town of Wiveliscombe to surprise a pair of real-life Golden Girls - Roberta and Enid, who have been friends for 71 years. Robbie is 91 and Enid 86. Robbie is almost completely blind and has mobility problems, so Enid has become her care, even though she herself has just been through a battle with breast cancer. They have settled in Somerset.
