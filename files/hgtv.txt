Jules Hudson is in the Dorset countryside helping a couple make the move from Queensland, Australia to family roots back in the UK. With a budget of Â£450,000, they look forward to enjoying village life in cooler climes. Jules also visits Tout quarry on the Isle of Portland, now home to a unique sculpture park celebrating the heritage of Portland stone, which was used for many of London's historic buildings.
