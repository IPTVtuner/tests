Ginny Buckley is house hunting with a couple who are looking to return to their Welsh homeland after twenty years of living in Oxford. The pair have a budget of Â£450,000 to find the right home in Carmarthenshire with enough land to accommodate visiting friends and their pooches. Elsewhere, Ginny samples a regional delicacy at Britain's only manufacturer of pickled cockles.
