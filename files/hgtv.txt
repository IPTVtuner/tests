In the second series of this design competition, a new crop of amateur interior designers try to impress judges Sophie Robinson and Daniel Hopwood in hopes of winning the competition that sees more than 20 hopefuls doing their best to successfully complete a series of challenges. The contestants are split into heats of three in the opening round, with those winners advancing to the next round of the tournament. The challenges - which task the players with making over rooms in actual homes - continue until a winner is named. Architectural historian Tom Dyckhoff is the show's presenter.
