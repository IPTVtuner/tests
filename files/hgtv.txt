In 2017, Lei Ying and her husband, David, snapped up a Belfast house after seeing the amount of space it could offer them. However, three years later and with their children growing fast, they have discovered that having lots of space is not always a good thing, especially when it's all in the wrong place. The layout means that mealtimes are spent in a tiny, stressful corner of the ground floor, and when they want to relax, the cavernous lounge is too big to be cosy.
