Alistair Appleton is in rural Shropshire with a couple who hope their Â£500,000 budget will buy them a shorter commute to work and more quality time together to enjoy the outdoors. Away from the excitement of the property search, Alistair meets Sam Gray, a passionate small holder, who rears her rare breed pigs ethically and balances the business of farming with raising her young family.
