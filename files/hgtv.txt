Dave and Margaret Hedley came across a picture of an old watermill in the Northeast that had been abandoned for the last 50 years and decided that they wanted to bring it back to life. Dave and Margaret put their hearts into the restoration, with experienced amateur builder Dave even designing the new mill water wheel which will allow them to generate hydro-electric power from the force of the river.
