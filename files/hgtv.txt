Sonali Shah is property shopping in South Wales with a couple who have a Â£230,000 budget to move out of Newport and buy their first home so they can raise their young family in the countryside. As the property search gathers pace, Sonali heads to the banks of the River Usk in Newport and learns about the incredible discovery and restoration of a 15th century ship, a project which now is of international importance.
