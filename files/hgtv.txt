Jonnie Irwin is rural house hunting in Pembrokeshire with an ambitious couple who have Â£650,000 to buy not only their first proper home together, but also need accommodation for holiday makers and a horse. Whilst in the area Jonnie visits Cardigan and meets a pioneering denim jean producer whose high calibre clothing has made great strides in recreating local jobs, and also keeping alive the denim manufacturing heritage of this area.
