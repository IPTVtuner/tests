In a special wild episode of Love Your Garden, Alan Titchmarsh and his team are in Bedfordshire, transforming a neglected outside space at Keech Hospice in Luton into a state of the art wildlife garden. Alan meets the staff and residents at Keech, a place where many people with life-limiting illnesses go to spend their final days. He realises how much a garden, and in particular a place for nature, could make a difference to people approaching the end.
