Sonali Shah is on a property-searching mission in North Wales with a mother who has a Â£295,000 budget and a goal to move close to her daughter, who has already made her escape to the area. Away from the house hunt, Sonali heads to Blaenau Ffestiniog and rides the zip line, one of the high points of adventure tourism which is making its mark in this former slate mining area.
