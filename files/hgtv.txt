Sonali Shah is house hunting with a couple who have a Â£750,000 budget to make the break from the Home Counties and return to their roots in the Derbyshire countryside. Sonali also puts her best foot forward and visits a longstanding family-run bootmaker in the Peak District, a reminder of the many local factories which once supplied the mining workforce during the Industrial Revolution.
