Architect George Clarke revisits Gareth Williams and his family. Four years ago Gareth decided he didn't want to live in a terraced house any more, so bought a derelict church. To save money he decided to do all the restoration work himself. Now George digs deeper into the fascinating history of this ancient building and also hopes to find out if church living is all it's cracked up to be.
