Upcycling entrepreneur Jay Blades is at Altrincham Recycling Centre in Greater Manchester, where he's searching the boots for potential loot. Assisting Jay in his mission to rescue, revamp and rehome three pieces of skip-bound junk are designer Sarah Peterson and blacksmith Kev Paxton. Sarah gets to grips with some old lampshades, while Kev attempts to transform some piling metal. Jay bags himself some windbreaker poles.
