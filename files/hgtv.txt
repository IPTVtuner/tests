Brummie best friends Sharon Hamilton and Val Murray have a budget of about Â£85,000 to buy a holiday home in Aruba, a Caribbean island just 20 miles north of Venezuela. They view a villa in the capital Oranjestad, a modern house with a pool on the edge of a National Park, and a lagoon house in the south of the island.
