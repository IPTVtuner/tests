Today, September 10
This week the team are in Gloucestershire at the home of Kathy Mason, a remarkable mother of two who has devoted her life to looking after others. For the past 18 years she has cared for her brother, who is in a wheelchair. She also nursed her mother and her husband, who both died of cancer within three years of each other, and she has fostered and adopted children with learning difficulties.
