Nicki Chapman is in the Somerset countryside helping a house-hunting couple with Â£475,000 return to their roots, and recreate the outdoor lifestyle that they grew up with for their own young children. Whilst in the county Nicki visits a farm which has diversified into making vegetable yoghurts, and before long is given free rein to invent her own unique flavour.
