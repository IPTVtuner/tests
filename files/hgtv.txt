Alan Titchmarsh and his team continue the fifth series of the garden makeover show. This week Alan and the gang are in Chessington, where they create a car-themed garden with some of the most inventive features ever seen in the series. The quirky outdoor sanctuary is for an unlikely hero - hospital worker and vintage car enthusiast Alan Rendall. In July 2014, Alan discovered his neighbour's house was on fire and immediately went to the rescue. The two families had been close friends.
