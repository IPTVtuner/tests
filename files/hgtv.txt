Jonnie Irwin is rural property searching with a couple from County Durham who want to border hop to the North Yorkshire countryside with their Â£600,000 pound budget, and buy a spacious country home with land to accommodate rescue donkeys. While in the area, Jonnie gets a masterclass in building dry stone walls, a distinctive feature of this county's farming landscape.
