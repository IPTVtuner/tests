Margherita Taylor heads to rural Lincolnshire with a decisive mother and son-in-law to help them find a comfortable country property for Â£650,000 to house three generations of their family, as well as providing a home for their much-loved horses. While the search gathers pace, Margherita takes in the splendour of Grimsthorpe Castle, the very last stately home built by the famous early 18th-century country-house architect, Sir John Vanbrugh.
