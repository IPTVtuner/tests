Alan Titchmarsh and his team return for fifth series of the makeover show in which they transform unloved spaces into dream gardens for some very special people. In the first episode, Alan and the gang travel to Walsall, where they plan to surprise a young widow. Nina Perrin Seedhouse has three children under seven, and with a trio of youngsters to look after, she has not had time for anything else much - consequently her garden is just a bare, blank canvas.
