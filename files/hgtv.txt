George meets Clive Bolton and his wife Jane, who dream of retiring and making their new home in a Grade II listed windmill on Anglesey. Derelict since the 1920s, it's situated on an island with picturesque views but fierce winds. George Clarke discovers its rich history and helps tackle the many design constraints of this beautiful round tapered structure.
