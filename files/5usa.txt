Two homeless men are beaten to death, and the Detectives quickly learn that a nearby car dealership security camera caught a beating on tape - one of them was one of the victims. As the investigation deepens, they learn one of the victims was in the Army in Iraq and one of the suspects was a soldier in Iraq - an odd coincidence that may connect the deaths.
