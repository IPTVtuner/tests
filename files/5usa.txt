After being released from prison, Lockhart & Gardner client Colin Sweeney attempts to convince the shareholders of his former company to vote him back in as CEO. At the last moment, however, a former employee accuses Sweeney of sexually harassing her and fathering her baby. Alicia has just 72 hours to prove that the allegations are false before Sweeney is forced out of his company for good.
