The NCIS team are called in to investigate when a woman claims to have witnessed the murder of a sailor. With skimpy evidence to go on, Gibbs turns the case over to McGee, who believes the woman's story is enough to continue the case, but when physical evidence of a crime isn't there, McGee pushes the team to keep looking because he senses there's more to the woman's story than meets the eye.
