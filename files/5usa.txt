Alicia and Diane are put in the strange position of representing a judge who has been accused of misconduct during a murder trial that he handled for the state as a prosecutor 20 years earlier. New DNA evidence has overturned the conviction, and Cuesta faces removal from the bench if he's found guilty. However, Alicia and Diane realise that his strict adherence to the truth could make him his own worst enemy in court.
