Alicia and Diane represent one of three girls convicted of a murder at a summer camp five years previously. Recently, a judge has overturned their sentence pending a new trial due to mishandling of DNA evidence. Fearing a wrongful conviction lawsuit, the state has offered the girls a plea bargain: they can go free, but only if they sign a statement admitting they were guilty.
