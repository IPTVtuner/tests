Gibbs entrusts the team with the task of finding his former commanding officer, who has gone on the run rather than staying behind to face charges of killing a Marine and stealing funds. Kate and Tony's investigation leads them to the missing man's cabin - which has been sprayed with bullets and contains an unidentified corpse. Mark Harmon stars.
