Lockhart & Gardner represents a client who suffered severe injuries and lost his wife when a snowmobile malfunctioned and struck a tree. However, Alicia and her legal team are opposed by the firm's nemesis, Louis Canning, who never gives in without a fight. Elsewhere, unable to raise enough money to make a down payment on her old house, Alicia starts to take Canning's offers of a lucrative job much more seriously.
