Stabler and Tutuola pair up to investigate when two teens go missing while their school is on a field trip to a local museum. Their investigation soon turns up evidence that the disappearance was staged to help Janey, who suffers from Turner syndrome, be with her older boyfriend, a man with a predilection for young girls, and to help the boy, Connor, make good on a gambling debt.
