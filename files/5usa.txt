Gibbs and the team are called in when a marine is discovered dead at the bottom of a cliff during a camping trip with his wife and best friend, who have had an affair. Gibbs plays the former lovers against each other during the interrogation, hoping to get one to say the other is guilty. Meanwhile, Abby must put her superb technical skills to the test when she reconstructs the camera that was broken during the marine's fall.
