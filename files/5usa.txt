A bartender from a popular dance club is in shock when he wakes up to find that the girl he spent the night with is lying dead next to him. Gibbs and his team are immediately called in when it turns out that the deceased is a petty officer who has been murdered. To confuse the investigation even further, the bartender denies that the woman found in his bed was the one that he initially took home.
