Gibbs is forced to come back out of his retirement to help Fornell and his daughter Emily, who are being threatened by a convict who has escaped from prison. Gibbs and the NCIS team reopen the convict's old robbery case and question a retired sailor, who is the only person to have contacted the convict after he was sent to prison. The investigation then leads the NCIS team to a surprising discovery.
