With no other ways to stop Adina's scheme, Bill has little choice but to make a dangerous journey whilst his comrades brace themselves for a brutal end. He'll then have to devise one final plan to save earth. It may prove to be too much for Bill who has already sacrificed so much for humankind. In space, Richard and Juliet can see how close humanity is to total destruction but they too must ask themselves how far they're willing to go to help the heroes on earth complete the mission.
