Beatrice returns with new baby Petra in her arms, and everyone gets soaked by the malfunctioning sprinklers during rehearsals for Aunt Auriel's summer play, so the cast have to relocate temporarily to Kingdom and Kingdom. Elsewhere, Lyle tries to help a young girl who is struggling to cope with caring for her sick mother and younger sister, and Simon's trial is dropped due to a lack of evidence.
