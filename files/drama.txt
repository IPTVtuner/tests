News arrives of a shooting at a posh school. Two boys are dead, one seriously injured and the PE teacher, ex-SAS man Lee Hartman, lies with a hole in his head and a gun in his hand in the same room. Rebus is troubled by inconsistencies at the crime scene, but his position is difficult - one of the dead boys is family. Unable to resist continuing with his own investigation, he becomes unhealthily obsessed by Hartman's world.
