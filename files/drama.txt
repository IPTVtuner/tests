Today, January 17
When his cousin Aubrey comes to stay, Clegg immediately calls for assistance to get rid of him. The man is a health fanatic and refuses to let Clegg join his chums for pointless, time-wasting walks in the hills. Aubrey soon discovers that while he is fit enough to beat Billy and Alvin at hill cycle racing, there is one challenge where they leave him standing - if only he could.
