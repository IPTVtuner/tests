Drama
Today, May 25
Beautiful, young socialite Iris Carr, bored with the raucous and unsociable behaviour of her friends whilst on holiday, resolves to seek out some tranquillity and travel home alone. Iris' expectations of peace are short-lived when, at the railway station, she suddenly faints. She wakes in time to be rushed onto the train, but with a pounding head and a feeling of being in a dream.
