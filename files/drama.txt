Albert has decided it's time for a break so he's off to Sin City to try his luck at the casinos, leaving the crew to fend for themselves in his absence. At the airport, as they are seeing Albert off, the team are greeted by a familiar face, `Liability' Finch, a bumbling, ex-grifter mate of Ash's from back in the day.
