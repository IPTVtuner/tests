Today, September 14
The knives are out as Hanssen's leadership continues to be questioned. Will the doubters win, or will inspiration from an unlikely source be enough? In a difficult medical argument, Jonny realises that he cannot please both Mo and Jac - who will he pick, and is he aware of the consequences? Is Sacha cut out for consultancy, or does an amusing medical case give him more answers than he thought?
