Drama
Today, November 20
The trial of two well-to-do drug-dealing brothers accused of murder collapses, and Rebus takes the rap. As an investigation is launched into his handling of the case, recriminations also begin outside of the law - the victim's father, a rival career criminal, threatens to dispense his own justice. As the violence threatens to spiral out of control, Rebus must attempt to solve new murders while being persecuted for past actions.
