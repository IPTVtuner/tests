Today, January 21
Miss Matty's house is full of life and bustle. Her dream of having a child in the house has been realised with the birth of Tilly, daughter of her maid Martha and carpenter Jem. Elsewhere, the shadow of the railway still looms, but the line has been halted five miles outside of Cranford - a disaster for the town, in Captain Brown's view.
