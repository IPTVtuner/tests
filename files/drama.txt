Today, April 29
The chance discovery of a camera and rolls of film hidden in a pub toilet leads the team to reopen the case of a young man murdered whilst working in a photography shop. The films contain some suspicious photographs and it seems possible that the motive for murder was linked to this, but it becomes apparent that the solution has more to do with the DNA found on the camera.
