Today, February 13
When word goes around town that Old Heptonstall is looking for volunteers, Hobbo and his army of volunteers, namely Alvin and Entwistle, go and visit him without a second thought. They find that he has a bad leg and is confined to the shed, where at least he doesn't have to listen to his wife's snoring. Tearfully, Heptonstall tells them he wants to go to the churchyard and bury a very dear friend.
