Ash is outraged to learn that his old football club has gone into administration, brought down by the greed of one corrupt football agent, Don Coleman. Time to get revenge; the team launch themselves into a high stakes con involving expert salesmanship and fake footballers. So far so good but when a last minute injury hits one of the team it looks like this might be one mark who's about to get away.
