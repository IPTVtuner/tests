Miles learns that a criminal called Billy Bunhill has been shot inside another notorious Kray haunt, The Blind Beggar pub. Chandler's interest is piqued when he realises that the murder mirrors George Cornell's killing by Ronnie Kray in 1966. Who could possibly be trading off the ghosts of the Krays and using their legend to invoke fear and paranoia on the streets of Whitechapel?
