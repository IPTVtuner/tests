Today, September 18
A Kosovan man is murdered on a notorious Edinburgh sink estate and Rebus is brought in to investigate. At first it appears to be a race crime, but Rebus is unconvinced and in his inimitable dogged manner discovers that in fact two other murders are linked to the initial crime. One of the victims is the brother of the lead thug on the estate and the other another Kosovan girl both of whom had been missing.
