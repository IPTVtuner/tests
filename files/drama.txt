Drama
Today, June 22
Bea and Evie come to the conclusion that they have to sell the House of Eliott. It's either that or accept money from Lord Alexander Montford and Jack Maddox, something which they are both loathe to do. Evie has the idea of designing for working women, a new departure for the House, and offers are coming in to design for the theatre, so maybe things are not so desperate after all.
