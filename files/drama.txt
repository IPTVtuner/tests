Drama
Today, September 16
Despised theatre critic Sylvester Le Fley is enraged when a priceless El Greco painting is stolen during a school trip to his luxurious stately home. For once, Jonathan Creek spots the solution almost immediately, but he hates Le Fley so much that he'll be damned if he's going to reveal how the theft occurred. Maddy is left to figure out how ornate woodwork and Spam sandwiches might provide an answer to the conundrum.
