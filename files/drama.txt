The team investigate the art of illusion when they reopen a case involving a magic trick that ended in murder, but powerful mind games and hypnosis prove a dangerous mix for Brian Lane, sending him down a destructive path. A session with the Magic Circle's Dr Moroni leaves a sceptical Gerry Standing feeling paranoid and his colleagues a little nervous around him.
