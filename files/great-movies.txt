Anachronistic sequel to `Shanghai Noon'. Two friends travel to 19th-century London to take back the Imperial Seal of China, which has been stolen by an evil English lord. Along the way they meet Jack the Ripper, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and a young Charlie Chaplin, and also find time to indulge in a little kung-fu fighting.
