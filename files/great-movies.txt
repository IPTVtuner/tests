Today, August 18
Warm-hearted tale about an all-American family who adopt a loveable puppy, little realising that the creature will grow into a 185-pound St Bernard. As Beethoven grows ever larger, the father becomes hostile, but the whole family rallies together when an evil dog-napper menaces their pet.
