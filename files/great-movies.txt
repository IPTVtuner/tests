When troubled young Angus finds a strange-looking egg on the shore of a Scottish lake, he resolves to take care of whatever is inside. Little could Angus have imagined what would hatch from the egg, but even the birth of a dinosaur-esque creature doesn't put him off. Instead, Angus sets about hiding the rapidly growing beastie from his mother and the Royal Artillery regiment.
