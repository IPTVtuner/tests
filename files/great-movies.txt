A retired criminologist teams up with a private detective to investigate the kidnapping of a champion racehorse. The stakes are raised when the steed's owners receive a ransom note for $100 million and the trainer is found dead. The absent-minded criminology professor must now put his failings behind him to solve the kidnapping before the horse is retired for good.
