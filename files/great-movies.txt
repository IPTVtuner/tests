A hypnotherapist specialising in dreams still blames herself for not preventing a patient's suicide two years ago. After setting up a new practice, she begins to wonder whether history is repeating itself when a new patient with a similar condition asks for her help. When other patients start to relapse, the therapist's life spirals out of control and she begins to wonder if this is all coincidence, or if there are more sinister forces at work.
