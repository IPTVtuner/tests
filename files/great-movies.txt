Crack commando Zohan Dvir is Israel's first line of defence against terrorism, but despite his prowess as a soldier, he dreams of just one thing: becoming a hair stylist in New York. When a battle with his arch-nemesis, a terrorist called `The Phantom', gives Zohan the opportunity to fake his own death, he flees to the Big Apple to follow his dreams. However, `The Phantom' learns that he is still alive.
