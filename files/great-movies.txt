The famous La Brea tar pits start bubbling, the first signs that a dormant volcano beneath the city has come to life, and before long lava is flowing through the sewers and the streets. Taking charge of the disaster is Mike Roark, head of the city's Office Emergency Management, assisted by scientist Dr Amy Barnes and his second-in-command Emmitt Reese. Can they save the city by diverting the threatening lava?
