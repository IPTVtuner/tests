A tale of two brothers - one a cab driver and the other a Wall Street trader - and their relationships with women. Their father tells them to do what makes them happy, but regrets his advice when one son marries a passenger whom he drives to New Orleans, and the other divorces his wife and announces his impending marriage to his mistress - who turns out to be an old flame of the other brother.
