A doctor moves to a new town only to find his patients falling victim to the offspring of a deadly tropical variety of the very creature he loathes - the spider. Fear grips the doctor's heart when it dawns on him that the spiders causing the deaths are nesting in his barn - and it falls upon him to save the otherwise placid small town.
