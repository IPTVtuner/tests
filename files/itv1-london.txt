Ed Chamberlin presents action from Ayr and Newbury - the feature race meeting of the day is at Ayr where the Scottish Grand National is the highlight and is sure to have a competitive field going to post. There's also an excellent supporting card including the Scottish Champion Hurdle and Future Champions Novices' Chase, plus Flat racing from Newbury including two classic trials.
