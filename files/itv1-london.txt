Explosives Officers Lana Washington and Joel Nutkins are called out to investigate a potential bomb factory in a London housing estate, but there's no sign of the bomb makers. Washington and Nutkins defuse an IED, but its complexity suggests they're dealing with sophisticated terrorists. As the police evacuate residents from the estate, an even deadlier terrorist threat emerges and Lana and Joel work against the clock to save as many lives as possible.
