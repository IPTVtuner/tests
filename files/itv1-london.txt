Another homeless man is found dead, clean-shaven and killed in the same manner as the previous victims. Geordie and Will realise that they may have sent the wrong man to prison, and the real killer may still be at large. Geordie wants to know if Robin told anyone about the killings or if he has an accomplice, but he and Will get to the asylum, only to find that Robin has taken his own life.
