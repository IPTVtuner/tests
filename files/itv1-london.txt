Chef Gino D'Acampo travels through the north and south of Italy, celebrating the women who have fuelled and fed his fellow Italians through the ages. Gino gets behind the wheel of a Ferrari in Emilia Romagna, the birthplace of this world-renowned sportscar. Also known as Italy's 'food basket', the region is characterised with its medieval cities of Bologna and Modena and is home to acres and acres of farmland producing meat, cheese, and its very own black gold in the form of balsamic vinegar.
