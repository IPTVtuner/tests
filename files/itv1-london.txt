Mark Pougatch is joined by Roy Keane and Ian Wright for coverage as Lee Carsley takes charge of the last game of his interim spell as coach with England entertaining the Republic of Ireland in their final 2024-25 UEFA Nations League match at Wembley - with Thomas Tuchel waiting in the wings to take over in 2025, Carsley will look to go out on a high and follow up the comfortable 2-0 win over the Irish in Dublin back in September 2024 when Jack Grealish and Declan Rice were on the scoresheet.
