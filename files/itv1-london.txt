In 2019, the president of Ghana announced the Year of Return calling for people of African descent from around the world to come to the country and celebrate their heritage - it was considered a huge success with hundreds of thousands of visitors, many of them African-American. Five years on from the scheme - and just weeks ahead of an upcoming election - Kafui Okpattah is in Ghana meeting those that left the US for good and asking why the African nation is now their home.
