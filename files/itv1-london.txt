Comedians and best mates, Rob Beckett and Romesh Ranganathan, go on a road trip to find out about their family history using DNA and genealogy. Romesh really wants to connect to his Sri Lankan heritage, having grown up in Crawley, while South Londoner Rob is simply hoping his family aren't all 'wrong'uns'.
