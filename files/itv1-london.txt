After the worst far-right violence in recent memory, this programme looks back at the breakdown in law and order on British streets in the summer of 2024 following the tragic fatal stabbings of three young girls in Southport - Paul Brand examines the consequences of online rumours and misinformation colliding with real-world events and why hundreds of people targeted ethnic minority communities and attacked the police over the course of a single week.
