French cuisine is at the heart of Raymond Blanc's repertoire, and his French classics have been on the menu at Le Manoir since the beginning. From his Oxfordshire kitchen, he shares his favourite French classics with a twist, from his Maman Blanc's steak and red wine jus, to a heritage salad with tomatoes and mozzarella straight from his gardens. Jean-Christophe Novelli surprises Raymond with a visit and cooks him a delicious Mouclade Des Boucholeurs.
