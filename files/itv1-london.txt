Ed Chamberlin presents coverage of racing from Newbury and Newcastle - the feature race of the day is the Coral Gold Cup at Newbury, a race with a superb roll of honour that always produces a thrilling contest. Elsewhere, the Fighting Fifth Hurdle, which often sees a Champion Hurdle hope begin the season in the northeast, is the highlight at Newcastle.
