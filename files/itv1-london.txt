This episode's Main Match is Zombie Game - players are either Zombies or Humans and the Zombies' objective is to turn the Humans into Zombies while the Humans avoid being turned. Players who struggled to get to the top spot in Gold Heist come up with a strong strategy and get themselves to a position of power while other players who may be too trusting come unstuck and end up vulnerable - as the pressure of the game gets to the players, an intense Death Match sends one more player home.
