After their impressive third place finish at the 2023 Rugby World Cup, England kick off their 2024 Six Nations campaign with a trip to Rome to face Italy - Owen Farrell's decision to step away from international rugby has been the headline story in the build-up, but new captain Jamie George will be a calming presence in Steve Borthwick's side along with the ever-dependable Maro Itoje and the dynamic Ben Earl. Meanwhile, Gonzalo Quesada is the new man at the helm for Italy.
