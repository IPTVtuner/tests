Alan Titchmarsh and the team create a cleverly designed family garden that's full of fun for pre-school tots without being a primary-coloured plastic eyesore for the grownups who share it. The team give tips on creating a mini-maze, creative sandpits and how to use plants to give an adventurous exotic flavour to the play areas in your garden.
