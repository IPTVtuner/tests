James' British adventure has crossed over the Irish sea to Northern Ireland, where he is joined by his great pal and famous local chef, Paul Rankin. Their first port of call is the Giant's Causeway, where James settles right in and cooks up a fish stew for the crowds of tourists. Paul goes in search of Irish gold and finds it in the form of rapeseed at the Kane family farm in Limavady.
