Her Majesty has been raising awareness of domestic and sexual violence for over a decade - in this film, she gives voice to the grieving families who have lost loved ones, to survivors, and to those working to end it. Around three women take their own lives each week as a result of domestic abuse - we are in a global pandemic of violence against women, but there is a lack of knowledge about its scale and how to resolve it across society.
