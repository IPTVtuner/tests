The Crown calls Detective Sam Chedid to the stand. Various pieces of evidence are introduced to the Court, including a disturbing video of Claire. During his cross examination, Colby throws suspicion onto Nathan Spears, as he points out the Detective's failure to investigate him as a potential suspect. The jurors share polarizing opinions on the trial thus far, as different personalities begin to rub each other the wrong way.
