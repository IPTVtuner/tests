In the concluding episode of their journey, Gino and Fred head to Croatia and are shocked by the 'over-tourism' in the holiday hotspot of Dubrovnik. As they continue their journey as 'conscientious travellers', Gino and Fred head out of the city to Mali Ston - a bay with world-renowned shellfish - before road-testing Croatia's answer to sustainable travel in the form of Agrotourism. Gino and Fred then cross the Adriatic for an off-grid adventure.
