John and Lisa bring us comforting and warming autumn dishes starting with smoked haddock with barley and salsa verde, a nourishing and hearty bowl of goodness - next up is John's Asian-inspired Singapore vegetable curry, a meat-free meal that is packed with veggies, flavour and colour. That's followed by Lisa's crispy duck cassoulet where Lisa has a very clever use for shop-bought crispy duck and adds it to this wholesome cassoulet.
