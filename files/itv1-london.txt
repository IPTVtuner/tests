Raymond brings us his take on salads, soups and sides including salad Nicoise and the Nordic specialty, pickled herrings with a warm potato salad and mustard dressing. Plus, chef Paul Ainsworth cooks up a sensuous Tuscan pressure pot broth, and Raymond stocks up on garlic from Le Manoir's gardens to create a beautiful and flavoursome garlic bread.
