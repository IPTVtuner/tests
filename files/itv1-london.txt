Alan Titchmarsh and the team present the makeover show, transforming unloved spaces into dream gardens for some very special people. In this episode, Alan and the team create a space-age garden in rural Cornwall for Chris Finney and his family. In 2003, Chris became the youngest serviceman ever to receive the George Cross, awarded for his extraordinary courage under fire, but since leaving the forces he has not always found civilian life easy.
