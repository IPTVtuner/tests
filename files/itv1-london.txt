Shivi kicks things off with a breakfast of sweet cinnamon bun monkey bread - a favourite with her own kids - before Jimmy checks in on his own hives to mark 150 years of the Beekeepers Association and mead maker Tom Gosnell joins them to showcase his sparkling mead made with honey. Shivi and Jimmy then turn their hand to making a 'mead-a-colada' before Shivi hits the road to meet the founder of a hot sauce business that has really taken off.
