In the early hours of the 11th of February, 2022, two 21-year-old men - Saqib Hussain and Hashim Ijazuddin - were found dead in a burning car on the A46 in Leicestershire. Within a short time, police arrested two unlikely culprits: 22-year-old TikTok influencer Mahek Bukhari and her 45-year-old mother Ansreen. Mahek from Stoke-on-Trent has over 160,000 followers on TikTok and many millions of views - her mum Ansreen regularly appeared in her videos.
