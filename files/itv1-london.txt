Ainsley is on a foodie voyage across the Mediterranean and this episode finds him exploring the Nuoro region of Sardinia, where his guide Claudio takes him to meet his parents who run a tiny local bakery specialising in pane carasau, a thin crispy bread that's found all over the island. Ainsley uses some in his first dish, pane frattau, layers of bread, tomato sauce and cheese topped with a poached egg - brunch is served.
