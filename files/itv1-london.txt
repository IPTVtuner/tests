John and Lisa kick off a show dedicated to traybakes with Lisa's tempting chocolate orange and brioche breakfast traybake - using shop-bought brioche and designed in a pretty orange shape, it's certainly a simple yet indulgent way to start the day. This is followed by Lisa's steak bolognese pasta bake - an alternative to bolognese, it can be made up in advance and leftovers can be frozen which makes it a perfect midweek family meal.
