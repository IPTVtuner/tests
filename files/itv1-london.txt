Ainsley is back in the kitchen, and this time he's welcoming former Euro-winning Lioness Jill Scott. On the menu is a dish inspired by Cameroon - spiced beef and peanut kebabs - as Ainsley and Jill chat about the Lioness's amazing achievements. Regular guest Candice Brown will be on hand to help with a speedy half-time treat, and this time it's a big one... an epic Homer Simpson sandwich!
