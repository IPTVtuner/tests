Laura Woods presents coverage alongside Ian Wright and Karen Carney as England's Lionesses return to action at Wembley Stadium in a high-profile friendly against Germany - this is the same venue where the two teams met in the final of Euro 2022 and where England beat the Germans to secure their first major trophy. This will be an important test for Sarina Wiegman's team as they start preparations for the retention of their crown at the 2025 European Championships in Switzerland.
