Alan is mingling at a Manor Farm summer party this time with legendary broadcaster and tennis player Sue Barker, interviewer and comedy writer Clive Anderson enjoying a wander down memory lane, and West End star Zizi Strallen brightening up the day with her stories of life on the stage - we're also pampering poultry with farmers Tom Davis and Charlie Dodd while horticulturist Camilla Bassett-Smith is helping to avoid any hosepipe bans with water-friendly planting.
