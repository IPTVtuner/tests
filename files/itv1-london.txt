Alan goes traditional with a twist, creating an elegant tea-garden for a charity volunteer known as the Cake Lady - a one-woman bakery - who has made cakes for more than 9,000 injured servicemen and women. The twist is that this new garden in Birmingham will have a fully equipped kitchen to bake in, and raised beds full of fresh ingredients to add to pies and cakes. Alan creates a colourful living wall that's perfect for any gardening novice, and Katie shares the tricks to a successful balcony.
