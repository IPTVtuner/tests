Back from his whistle-stop culinary tour, Gino returns to his hometown and the heart of his extended Italian family. He cooks a modern twist on a traditional aubergine parmigiana in the foothills of Mount Vesuvius before hosting duties begin. It's all hands on deck for Gino and his relatives to prepare an Italian feast to honour his Aunt Clara and toast her with a special wild fennel spritz.
