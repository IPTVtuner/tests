The time has come to cross the border from Scotland to England and where better to begin this leg of the journey than James' home country of Yorkshire. Here he's joined by Michelin starred chef Lisa Allen. His first stop is Whitby where he's popping into his favourite fish and chip shop before cooking tikka mackerel buns with fennel and apple salad for the crowds at Whitby bandstand. Lisa is paying a visit to The Black Swan.
