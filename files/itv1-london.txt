Alan Titchmarsh and team set out to demonstrate the dos and don'ts of how to create a stylish contemporary garden. Inspired by the idea of creating outside rooms in your garden, Alan creates a contemporary garden complete with outside gym, kitchen, lounge, office and even a floral hallway for a family that has turned personal struggles into a thriving charity. Helping him create the super cool garden, despite the rain, are Katie Rushworth and David Domoney.
