Alan Titchmarsh is in South Wales tackling the most difficult plot the team has ever faced. Father of three Chris Garlick, who lost his hands and feet to sepsis just 22 months earlier, is moved to tears by the fabulous family garden created for him and his young family. Full of exciting ideas, the garden is evocative of the surrounding countryside with all the stylish features a young family would expect.
