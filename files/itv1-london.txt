Alan surprises a group of senior citizens in busy Thornton Heath, and turns an urban wasteland into a welcoming oasis of swaying grasses and pretty daisy flowers. The team share tips on how to achieve the look of a miniature prairie even in a tiny space, tricks for creating a cost-effective water feature from skip material, and how to choose the best low-maintenance shrubs to green up even the shadiest of spots in your garden.
