Steve Rider presents highlights of the sixth round of the 2024 British Touring Car Championship from Croft Circuit in North Yorkshire - reigning champion Ash Sutton is fighting for a record fifth BTCC title but will not have enjoyed a six-week summer break after a disastrous result in the last two races at Oulton Park where he finished out of the points and now lies third in the standings behind Tom Ingram and new leader Jake Hill. The Kent-born driver made it five wins from the past nine races.
