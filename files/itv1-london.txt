Ed Chamberlin and Francesca Cumani present coverage of racing from Newmarket and Haydock - the feature meeting of the day is at Newmarket where the Group One Middle Park and Cheveley Park Stakes are top-level juvenile contests, and the day is rounded off by one of the biggest betting races of the season in the form of the ultra-competitive Cambridgeshire Heritage Handicap. Analysis comes from Jason Weaver, reporting from Sally Ann Grassick and Oli Bell, and commentary from Richard Hoiles.
