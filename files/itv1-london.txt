As James' British Adventure draws to a close, he is headed for Devon to hook up with his old mate Michael Caines, who just happens to be a Michelin-starred chef and owner of Lympstone Manor, a country house hotel and restaurant with stunning views over the River Exe. After a quick look around and a spot of foraging, James sets up his kitchen amongst Michael's young vineyard to make guinea fowl with heather and brambles.
