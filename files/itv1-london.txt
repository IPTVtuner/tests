England kicked off the Thomas Tuchel era with wins against Albania and Latvia, and now they travel to Andorra for another 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying match - after a hugely impressive end to the 2024-25 season, Crystal Palace's FA Cup hero Eberechi Eze will be pushing for a place in the starting line-up. Mark Pougatch is joined by Roy Keane and Karen Carney for coverage of this match, with commentary coming from Sam Matterface and Lee Dixon.
