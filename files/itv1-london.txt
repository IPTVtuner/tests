Ed Chamberlin and Francesca Cumani present action from Newmarket and York - Newmarket stages a superb card with the Dewhurst Stakes, a race which is likely to determine which is the best two-year-old of the season, being the highlight. There's also one of the last big handicaps of the Flat season in the form of the two-and-a-quarter mile Cesarewitch - analysis comes from Jason Weaver, Kevin Blake and Adele Mulrennan, reporting from Matt Chapman, and commentary from Richard Hoiles.
