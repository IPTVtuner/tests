More than 500 million pounds was stolen from people aged over 65 in England and Wales in 2023, but it is unclear how much of this was as a result of fraud by someone known to the victim - this episode examines financial abuse of older people by their own family, friends and those in positions of trust and asks what can be done to protect them, their money and their property.
