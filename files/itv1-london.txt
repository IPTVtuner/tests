We follow store manager Dior preparing for the move to a new 15-million-pound shop, the creation of a new Percy Pig product that the marketing team are hoping will rescue the little-known beauty department, and the daring and bold new women's autumn clothing range launched after years of fighting bad reviews and poor sales.
