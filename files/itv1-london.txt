We visit Britain's most popular national park, the Lake District. Julia Bradbury will be hiking up England's third highest peak, the mighty Helvellyn. Ben Fogle tests his own head for heights with an unusual climbing experience at Honister slate mine. In the wild Borrowdale Valley, Ray Mears meets some of Britain's biggest ants, while Ade Edmondson captains a vintage steamer on the waters of lake Ullswater.
