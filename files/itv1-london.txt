Ainsley's kicks off his journey across the Mediterranean in style on board a 44ft catamaran, where skipper Jean-Hughes teaches him the basics of sailing and they drop anchor in a crystal-clear cove on the island of Lavezzi, where Ainsley tries his hand at paddle boarding. He cooks up some delicious recipes in the boat's galley kitchen, including some sensational seafood skewers with pepperonata and a quick and tasty Corsican mint omelette.
