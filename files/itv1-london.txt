From the makers of The Chase comes a quiz show that sees contestants compete to be part of the Winning Combination. Presented by Omid Djalili, this perfect storm of players, money and general knowledge questions could see four players walk away with some serious cash. In each episode, the game begins with each contestant drawing a number from one to nine. General knowledge battles whittle the players - and numbers - down to four. In the final round, their four numbers represent not only the four-digit jackpot they could share, but also how many questions they must answer correctly against the clock. The bigger the jackpot, the harder it is to win - with speedy buzzer rounds, fiendish multiple choice questions and tactical play, there's something for every quiz fan. Who has what it takes to be part of the Winning Combination?
