Jimmy Akingbola hosts the classic panel show with a twist - this time Axel Blake, Josh Jones, Fatiha El-Ghorri and Slim join team leaders Chizzy Akudolu and Eddie Kadi to take viewers on a tour of Black British history. Insightful, educational, bold, tongue-in-cheek and above all very funny, the teams do battle over four rounds - it's history with a touch of colour.
