Ed Chamberlin presents coverage of National Hunt racing from Ascot, Haydock and Wincanton - the feature meeting of the day is at Ascot where the Grade One Ascot Chase could feature horses that will line up in the Ryanair Chase at March 2024's Cheltenham Festival. There's also a key trial for the Champion Hurdle at Wincanton where the Kingwell Hurdle takes centre stage, and the focus shifts towards the Grand National at Haydock with the Grand National Trial being the best race on the card there.
