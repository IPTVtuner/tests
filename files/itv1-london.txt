Today, December 23
Shunned by the relentlessly happy citizens of Whoville, the Grinch retreats to his gloomy lair on Mt Crumpit. Come December, the only one smiling is the Grinch, who's stolen everyone's presents. However, little Cindy Lou sees some good in the furry grouch, so there may be a merry Christmas after.
