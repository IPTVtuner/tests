Francesca Cumani presents racing from four different venues on a superb day of racing - the feature meeting of the day is at Haydock where two sprint races, the Temple Stakes for older horses over five furlongs, and the Sandy Lane Stakes over a straight six furlongs for three-year-olds take centre stage. There is also competitive racing from Goodwood and York while the Curragh stages the first Classic of the Irish season as top-class colts go to post in the 2,000 Guineas.
