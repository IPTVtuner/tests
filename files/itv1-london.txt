Raymond shares his love of new produce from the gardens and explains why seasonality is important and why we should all embrace it. From his Oxfordshire kitchen he cooks pan-fried salmon, with spinach and chive butter sauce, to a walk in the woods, where he rustles up a fricassee of wild mushrooms. Long-time friend Jean-Christophe Novelli pays Raymond a visit and bakes him an indulgent tarte tatin, baked apple with caramel.
