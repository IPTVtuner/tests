Alan Titchmarsh and the team demonstrate how to bring a woodland into your garden as they create a cross between a woodland glade and a forest school for care worker Carl and his family. Inspired by Japanese `forest bathing', woodland dens, natural play, dramatic trees and undergrowth teeming with wildlife, Alan, Katie Rushworth and Danny Clarke transform a Macclesfield back garden into a slice of nature, complete with family seating, a woodland Wendy-house and a lift for wife Elle's wheelchair.
