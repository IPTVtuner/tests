Joining Alan at Manor Farm this time are Mark Gatiss and Patsy Kensit to provide the chat - our guide dog in training Titch also makes a welcome return, we celebrate everything that's great about the Great British classic car, TikTok sensation farrier Sam Wolfenden is back by popular demand to provide another masterclass, and we catch up with the incredible people at the Folly Wildlife Centre.
