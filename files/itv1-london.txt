Charlie Bucket comes from a poor family, and spends most of his time dreaming about the chocolate that he loves but usually can't afford. Things change when Willy Wonka, head of the very popular Wonka Chocolate empire, announces a contest in which five gold tickets have been hidden in chocolate bars. Charlie is one of the five kids who finds a lucky ticket and goes on a tour of Wonka's chocolate factory.
