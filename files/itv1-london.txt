Hugh Woozencroft presents Gallagher Premiership rugby coverage as Saracens take on Harlequins - it's a very special occasion as the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium hosts a match billed as Showdown 4 between two of the most famous names in English rugby and in front of a bumper crowd at the 80,000-seater venue. Former England captain Owen Farrell should line up against the exciting Marcus Smith and a host of other internationals.
