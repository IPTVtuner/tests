It's Christmas Day down in Hampshire, and James is spending the big day with his guests Hannah Waddingham, Denise Van Outen, and pianist and composer Alexis Ffrench - there are recipes for prawn cocktail, roast chicken, salmon mousse and smoked mackerel pate, and James also serves up a Christmas cheeseboard. Dishes from chefs Galton Blackiston and Paul Ainsworth are also whipped up, there is mulled cider courtesy of Merlin Griffiths, and a musical surprise takes place at the end of the show.
