Ainsley is back in his kitchen, and this time he is exploring fruity flavours both savoury and sweet - and starting with the most important meal of the day, breakfast. Ainsley whips up fruity granola breakfast cranachan and a tropical smoothie - meanwhile, chef April Jackson works wonders with plantain. Actor and comedian John Thomson then joins Ainsley to make a fruity cherry clafoutis, and that's before Ainsley wraps things up with a pan-fried pork chop and apples with a miso-cider sauce.
