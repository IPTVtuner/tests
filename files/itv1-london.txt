Alan and his team are in Barry, Wales, to create an accessible and flexible family garden for ex-Army soldier Dale, who lost a leg in Afghanistan. Alan also creates a pathway to allow him to access every corner of his new, modern family garden. Meanwhile, 150 miles away in Berkhamsted, Danny Clarke shows how to create a very different style of family garden, based around lazy lawns, a wildlife pond and soft seating for a single mum and her two young kids.
