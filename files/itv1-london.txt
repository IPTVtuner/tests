Ed Chamberlin presents coverage of six races on the final day of the 2025 Cheltenham Festival - as always, the highlight of the final day is the Gold Cup and this year sees Galopin Des Champs try to become one of the very few stars to win this great race for a third time. The supporting card features five excellent contests including the Triumph Hurdle, the Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle, and the amateur jockeys having the spotlight on them in the St James' Place Challenge Cup.
