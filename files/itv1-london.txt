When the jurors are taken to Kate's house to observe a demonstration of the Crown's theory, it ends in disaster for the Defence when someone tampers with Kate's studio. Back in the courtroom, an eyewitness testifies he saw Kate at 4am out on the water the night Claire disappeared. Kate's brother, Robbie, takes the stand, before the jurors are left perplexed when a man from Kate's past causes a disturbance in the courtroom.
