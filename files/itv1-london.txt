Mark Pougatch is joined by Roy Keane and Ian Wright as Premier League rivals Aston Villa and West Ham meet for the first time in the FA Cup since 1980 - the Second Division Hammers triumphed that time 1-0 in a sixth round tie at Upton Park en route to famously winning the trophy by beating Arsenal at Wembley.
