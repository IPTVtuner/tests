Seema Jaswal presents coverage from Ashton Gate, the home of Bristol City, as England return to action by taking on Belgium in the 2025 UEFA Women's Nations League - the last fixture cycle saw mixed results where a disappointing draw in Portugal was followed by a fantastic win against world champions Spain at Wembley. This means that the Lionesses sit second in the table on the same number of points as Portugal.
