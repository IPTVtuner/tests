Today, June 19
A reverse ramming sends Chris reaching for german shepherd Ronny, Lee is confronted by a particularly mouthy motorist, Liam arrests a man who denies carrying out a shocking attack, tasers are drawn after a van driver causes carnage, and a wanted man holes up in a loft and refuses to come quietly.
