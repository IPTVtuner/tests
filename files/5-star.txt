Marcus has always knew he was going to be a rapper, but when his mother is murdered, he turns to dealing - hustling drugs pays the rent. As his world spirals out of control, he begins to apply the same manic intensity to his writing as he does to dealing; he has to write down his words to stay sane. For years, he endures this living hell until a tragedy that nearly kills him prompts Marcus to change his life.
