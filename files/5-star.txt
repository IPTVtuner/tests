Eye-popping comedy about a mild-mannered bank clerk who is transformed into a zoot-suited, cartoon-style creature after finding a strange mask in a river. Wearing the mask gives him superhuman abilities and enables him to defeat all who stand in his way. He vows to woo a beautiful nightclub singer, but is unaware of her criminal intentions.
