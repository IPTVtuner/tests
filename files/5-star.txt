Today, March 10
There is a hair-raising pursuit through the market town of Ripley which sees a driver mounting pavements, hitting cars and even colliding with an ambulance. An Interceptor has a narrow escape when an out of control driver crashes into his car. A drunk driver goes for the world record in failed breathalyser tests and the helicopter is called in when a Land Rover driver decides to take a pursuit off-road.
