A down-on-her-luck actress accepts an offer to star in a film shot on a mysterious island. While there, the actress is abducted by natives who offer her as a sacrifice to a giant ape, which instead of harming the starlet becomes smitten with her. The crew manage to capture the ape and bring it back to Manhattan to exhibit as a showpiece. However, on the show's opening night, things go horribly wrong.
