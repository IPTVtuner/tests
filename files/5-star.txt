Dexter has decided to be involved in the baby's life, and so he and Rita decide to tell the kids. But when Astor isn't too keen and asks why they're not married, Dexter proposes to Rita. When Rita declines, Dexter must then come up with a way to get her to say yes. Meanwhile, Rita's hormones are up to full speed and her short-tempered treatment of a hotel guest gets her fired.
