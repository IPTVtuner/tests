The year is 1954 and `United States Marshal' Teddy Daniels, together with his `sidekick' Chuck, docks on the remote Shutter Island - greeted by guards. Their `purpose' is to investigate the disappearance of a murderess named Rachel Solando, who escaped from the island's hospital for the criminally insane. She is presumed to be hiding on the island, but all is not as it seems.
