Today, October 20
Scott and Adam discover a huge stash in the boot of a car, and a runaway dealer just misses mowing down Gary. The crime-fighting spree continues when Ady collars a car thief and the interceptors are called to a pub fight on New Year's Eve. Throw in five cars pursuing a runaway on a busy motorway and you are in for quite a ride.
