The Ice Truck Killer strikes again, leaving a real nightmare before Christmas at Santa's Cottage. Dexter notices that the kill is not as `tidy' as the previous kills, as if the Ice Truck Killer is rushing to leave Miami. However, in reality, the Ice Truck Killer has kidnapped someone very close to Dexter to lure him into a trap that will change Dexter's life forever.
