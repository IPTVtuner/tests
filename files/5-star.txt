Parody of the teen horror genre in which a group of dim-witted teenagers accidentally kill a man in a car crash and hide the body. One year later, they are being terrorised by a sinister serial killer and as the body count rises, they also have to contend with the attentions of a persistent and annoying reporter and an eccentric high-school principal.
