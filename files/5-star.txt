Calvin, a short and tiny criminal, has just committed a robbery involving stealing a precious diamond from a jewellery store along with his dim-witted partner, Percy. However, the snatch goes awry, and Calvin ends up ditching the diamond by stashing it in a woman's purse. Calvin must now pose as a young infant in order to retrieve the stolen diamond.
