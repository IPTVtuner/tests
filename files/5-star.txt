Spoof of 1960s spy films, in which cryogenically preserved secret agent Austin Powers is revived in the present day. Once synonymous with style, Powers soon realises that his vocabulary, fashion sense and attitude to women are hopelessly out of date. He enlists the help of a decidedly modern woman to help him adjust to the 1990s and vanquish his old adversary, Dr Evil.
