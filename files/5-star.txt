Dexter argues with Rita because of her desire for them to move in together before they get married. While playing golf together, Miguel tells Dexter about a husband he has been unable to convict, who killed not one but two of his wives for financial gain. Dexter sees him as the perfect candidate, and tracks the murderer to Bimini. However, while Dexter is on the hunt, Rita has a medical emergency.
