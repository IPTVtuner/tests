Chazz Michael Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy are the two titans of skating. At the Winter Olympics, the fierce rivals find themselves forced to share the winner's podium when they both score gold. The shower of glory doesn't last for long, as the pair descend into fisticuffs and set the mascot on fire. Disgraced and stripped of their medals, they can get back on ice, but only if they dance with each other as a pair.
