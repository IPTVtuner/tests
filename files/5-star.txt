Billy is the son of hotel chain magnate Brian Madison and expects to inherit the family fortune, but he's shocked when his father stipulates he won't unless he passes 12th grade in just 24 weeks. It will be tough, since he never passed 1st grade. Determined to prove his father wrong, Billy enrols at school.
