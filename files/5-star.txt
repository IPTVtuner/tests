Ben Marco is a member of a patrol saved by Raymond Shaw. Shaw was awarded the Medal of Honour and is now standing for Vice President under the stern eye of his controlling mother Eleanor, but she is a pawn of big business, who want their own man in the White House. Marco, however, keeps having disturbing nightmares and discovers he is being controlled not by brainwashing but by implanted chips.
