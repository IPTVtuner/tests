Primatologist Davis Okoye shares an unshakable bond with George, an extraordinarily intelligent silverback gorilla that's been in his care since birth. When a genetic experiment goes wrong, it causes George, a wolf and a reptile to grow to a monstrous size. As the mutated beasts embark on a path of destruction, Okoye teams up with a discredited genetic engineer and the military to secure an antidote and prevent a global catastrophe.
