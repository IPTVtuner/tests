Primatologist Davis Okoye shares an unshakable bond with George, an extraordinarily intelligent silverback gorilla that's been in his care since birth.

As the mutated beasts embark on a path of destruction, Okoye teams up with a discredited genetic engineer and the military to secure an antidote and prevent a global catastrophe.
