When Homer leaves Bart by the squid port and strangers take pity on the street urchin, giving him money, Homer and Bart turn to a life of scamming. They scam Dr Hibbert and Ned Flanders, and Grampa even helps them con his fellow retirement home residents, but are they accomplished enough to avoid detection?
