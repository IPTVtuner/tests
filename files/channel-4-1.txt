Frasier hires a butler who spoils everyone in the household and offers Frasier some sage advice to help him in his bid to join the snobbish opera board. Elsewhere, Daphne wonders aloud if she and Niles will ever be able to declare their love and is further demoralised when Mel shows up at Frasier's party, forcing Niles to play along as her dutiful husband.
