Since the death of their parents, Andi and Bruce have moved between foster homes, accompanied by their dog Friday, until they end up with the Scudders, who follow a strict no-pets policy. The siblings look for a place to hide Friday, and run into a dilipidated hotel, which they turn into a pound for homeless mutts, but when the Scudders become suspicious, they must keep their hotel a secret, or risk being sent away.
