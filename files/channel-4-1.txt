Homer asks Mr Burns for a pay rise after the family have to dress up as a Mariachi band and sing for their dinner, but Mr Burns has a better idea, hiring Homer as his prank monkey, paying him to throw pudding at Lenny, eat an expensive Spider-Man comic in front of Comic Book Guy, and enter the panda enclosure at the zoo in a panda costume.
