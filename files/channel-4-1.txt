When Bart pulls a prank on Skinner's weather balloon, his punishment is to help the headmaster with his amateur astronomy. Bart then spots a comet heading straight for Springfield, and unfortunately the scientists' failed attempts to stop it with a missile destroy the only bridge out of town. So the whole town heads for the Flanders' bomb shelter, which has room for almost everyone.
