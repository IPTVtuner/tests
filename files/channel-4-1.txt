Channel 4 +1
Today, November 13
This week's competition takes place in and around Leeds, where the first to host is 24-year-old digital account manager Alice. Alice has never held a dinner party before, but she's hoping her family favourites will hit the spot and win her the grand. She's hoping to impress Danielle, Andy, Lynne and Matt. With gob-smacking revelations, cringe-worthy party tricks and a huge Pavlova, can Alice walk away with the prize?
