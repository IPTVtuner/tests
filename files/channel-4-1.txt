When Homer ends up in the prison infirmary after visiting the prison rodeo, Marge notices the artistic talent of jailbird Jack Crowley and vouches for him at his parole hearing. However, when she gets him a job painting a mural at the school, he clashes artistically with Principal Skinner. Meanwhile, Homer sets up a chiropractor business with the help of an old dustbin, aka the Spine-O-Cylinder.
