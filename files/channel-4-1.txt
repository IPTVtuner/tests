Homer tries, but fails, to eat an old box of baking soda, losing a $50 bet with Bart. So, Bart and Millhouse go on a shopping spree and end up running Comic Book Guy's shop after he has a heart attack. While the boys transform the shop, the convalescing Comic Book Guy falls for a female Springfield resident just as sarcastic as he is.
