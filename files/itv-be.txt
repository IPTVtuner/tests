As the Housewives return to Cheshire, there's bad news for the Bardsleys as a death in the family causes heartbreak and Debbie realises her own grief may have had some unexpected side effects. It's business as usual with Lystra pulling out all the stops at her latest restaurant whilst Seema looks to the future as she prepares to open a cosmetic clinic. However, Lauren has some home truths to deliver and Hanna starts to question why Nicole keeps finding herself in hot water.
