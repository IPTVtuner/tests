It's Singletown's second Love Locket Ceremony, presided over by matchmaking mentors Emily and Joel, and this week this life-changing decision is harder than ever. Will the exes decide to get back together and return home as a couple, or will they stay single and remain in Singletown? Before they are face to face with their exes at the ceremony, the singletons enjoy what could be their last night out in Singletown.
