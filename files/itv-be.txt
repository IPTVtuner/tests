A cast of brave singletons check out of modern day dating and check in to three stunning remote log cabins. Tonight the first matched pairs immediately move into their cabins, but every 24 hours they'll have to decide whether to extend their stay another day or call it quits and leave. If they're still hunkered down when check out comes there's one big decision left to make - head home separately or depart as an exclusive Cabins couple.
