After a hectic few months, the Shepherds jet off to their favourite place on Earth - the Maldives - for some much-needed family downtime, but the challenges of three children, tears and tantrums keep Billie and Greg on their toes. The couple go head to head as Arthur tries out a new hobby, but when romance blossoms as Greg pulls out all the stops for a date night in paradise, he finally contemplates having 'the snip'.
