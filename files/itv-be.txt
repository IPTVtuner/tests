Chris and Jennifer's house may be big enough for the average family, but with nine children, three bedrooms, a home classroom and just one bathroom, space is at a premium. In order to afford a much-needed bigger home, they have no choice but to make their tired old property sellable. Drew and Jonathan come up with an ambitious kitchen and bathroom overhaul, and get the kids working on a surprise for their Mom and Dad.
