David and his team of reps face one of their most surprising weekenders yet, and that's not just down to Jordan's birthday. Jordan is even more excited than normal as it's his birthday, but although he takes every opportunity to tell everyone, including the new guests, he is kept waiting for any recognition of it until the second day when David throws him a party, including the surprise arrival of Isobel.
