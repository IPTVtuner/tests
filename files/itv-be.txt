In The Cabins and away from the trappings of modern-day dating, three more 24-hour dates are underway. Nature has brought an end to this year's mating season, but for one lucky dater there's a second chance of love just before The Cabins close their doors. In the cabin next door, they have a big decision to make before they leave, but nothing a bit of axe throwing won't help them figure out - will our final couple be a match made in heaven?
