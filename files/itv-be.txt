As the novelty of the chore chart wears off Billie and Greg continue to address the kid's behaviour. With Nelly's Birthday approaching Billie and Greg debate whether to get her the phone she so desperately wants. They take a family trip to a history museum in an attempt to show them just how lucky they are. And after turning up to Sue's house drunk, Billie and her mum decide it's time to have an emotional heart to heart with Chatty.
