Jimmy heads to Florida's east coast as his journey takes him to New Smyrna Beach and he tests his limited surfing abilities in the Atlantic waves before meeting local chef David for a culinary lesson in classic Southern grits. Jimmy then travels on to the Kennedy Space Centre where tour guide Richard takes him to see the iconic launchpads where many of NASA's space missions began, and he also talks space food with former astronaut Winston Scott before exploring how food could be grown on Mars.
