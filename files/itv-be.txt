After lavish summer holidays away, the Housewives are back together again. A VIP day out at the Cheshire Horse Trials is on the horizon, but can Seema and Hanna's ongoing issues be resolved, and will Lystra and Nicole finally put their disagreements to bed? Tanya pleads with her mum Julie and daughter Gabriella not to go under the knife; Rachel and Nick bring their two families closer together and Debbie flaunts her new figure. Plus, a brand new Housewife arrives with her pop star hubby in tow - but will this power couple hit the right notes with the rest of the ladies?
