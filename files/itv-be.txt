Gino starts his epic journey in France. From the Alpine town Breil-Sur-Roya he can travel into Italy in style on a train journey that takes him right through the Alps. In Italy, he meets a local doctor who does his rounds on horseback, through vineyards and hazelnut groves, where Gino prepares a scrumptious chocolate cheesecake. He travels on to the beautiful city of Turin, where he gets a personal tour - Italian Job style - in the seat of a classic Fiat 500.
