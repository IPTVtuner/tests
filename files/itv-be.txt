Tensions in the Shepherd household are high as we find Billie and Greg in the middle of a huge bust-up, but will the couple make up in time to celebrate Greg's birthday in just a few days' time? Elsewhere, Arthur is turning six, so Billie and Greg surprise him with a chicken wing party and a dream trip away - later, Greg laps up the limelight as childcare issues mean that he has to do his first red carpet alone while Billie is left at home looking after the kids.
