A Merry Christmas to one and all! At least that's what The Real Housewives of Cheshire will be hoping gets delivered this festive season. Nicole and Hanna's recent reconciliation was nothing short of a Christmas miracle, but will Hanna and Seema be singing from the same hymn sheet before Santa's sleigh takes flight? Lauren says goodbye to her family home, Debbie reconnects with the group and the gender of Cheshire's newest baby is finally revealed.
