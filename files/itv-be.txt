It's another new day in Singletown and Sophie is still buzzing from her cocktail-filled date with boxer boy Mason last night. Next to take their first steps back into the dating world are Rob and his ex, Claudia, as their celebrity mentors Joel and Emily have hand-picked a sexy single for both of them. Back in the apartments, Luke receives a message to say he'll also be taking to the skies on a helicopter ride over London.
