Ferne, daughter Sunday and best friends Carl, Ellis and Sara hit the road for a five-day staycation to Cornwall. After a very long drive down to the campsite, sorting sleeping arrangements out proves a step too far and the first morning breakfast nearly burns the RV down. They head to the beach for some sun, sea and surfing, and visit a sea sanctuary where Ferne adopts a seal for Sunday. Emotions run high during a burning ceremony on their last night.
