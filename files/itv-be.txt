After the shock of running into her ex Jack at the Halloween party, Frankie is in turmoil, but when Jack is confronted by the once-friendly Chloe Sims, will he stand firm with his own truth? Having apologised for her insensitive text messages towards Frankie, Chloe Brockett is keen to make it clear that things aren't always black and white, and Frankie might not be as innocent as she claims to be, but is this one step too far for her friendship with Amy?
