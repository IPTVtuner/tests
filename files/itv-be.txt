Fred arrives in Dublin on the ferry from Holyhead and sets off north towards Newcastle in County Down. Heading into the heart of the Mourne Mountains on a route that will really test his stamina, Fred pushes himself to cycle up to Spelga Dam, which is perched 1,000 feet above sea level, for one of the best panoramic views of the mountains - along the way, Fred fuels up with a traditional Ulster fry and meets some fascinating locals including the team behind the Killowen poitin distillery.
