Reality series where homeowners are offered help to transform their homes into something that works for them. Sweden's greatest exports are more than just meatballs and flat-pack furniture - it also sent Erik into Laura's arms. They purchased a rustic cottage in rural Tennessee to settle down together and Erik had grand visions of rebuilding it with his own bare hands, but Laura's pregnancy has forced a due date on the project, so they're calling in help from Kortney and Kenny.
