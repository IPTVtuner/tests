Gino's journey begins in the Italian capital of fashion - Milano. Here he visits a local institution, an elegant cocktail bar who were the first to introduce the idea of the aperitivo in Milan. Inspired by his visit to Milan, Gino cooks traditional Milanese veal for the cyclists before getting back on the train to the medieval town of Bergamo. Here, he meets local ice cream maker Niccolo, whose family created one of Italy's most loved ice cream flavours, Stracciatella.
