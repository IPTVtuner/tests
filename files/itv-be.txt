The Shepherds have some big changes coming. With Arthur's first day at school fast approaching, Billie and Greg take him uniform shopping but Arthur is not so keen. Greg also gets suited up for his first store appearance as well as setting in motion his dreams to be a radio DJ. The family celebrate Arthur's last day at nursery at his graduation ceremony and with both nursery and school over for the summer they hit the road and head off on a staycation in Dorset.
