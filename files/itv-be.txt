It's the final week in Singletown and celebrity mentors Emily and Joel have a surprise for the residents of Riverside and Cityside - they've arranged for the singletons to meet each other's exes at a boys' night out and a girls' night in. For the very first time, they get to hear what their exes have been up to and what they've been saying about them, from the people they live with. But for some, the news isn't what they want to hear and the repercussions rock both apartments.
