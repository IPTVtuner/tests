The farm opens up to the public for an Easter event that is Liz and Kelvin's chance to bring in more income to support the farm, and there's drama in the lambing shed when a a vet attends to a ewe that is struggling to give birth and needs to give the sheep an emergency Caesarean section - elsewhere, it's time to train the cows and get them used to being on head collars as Kelvin enters them into the Royal Cheshire Show.
