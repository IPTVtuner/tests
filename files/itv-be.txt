Jimmy heads to St Pete on Florida's west coast and sets sail with skipper Mark as he learns all about a local delicacy before attempting to catch one - moving inland, he then visits urban farmer Brad, takes a tour of his hydroponic farm, and learns how farming in shipping containers can have its upside. Jimmy's journey then takes him to Ybor City in Tampa Bay to meet Andrea, whose family has overseen Florida's oldest restaurant for 118 years.
