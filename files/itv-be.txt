We return to the world of luxury pawnbroking where assets can be worth six figure sums. Customers can either sell their assets or borrow money against them but risk losing their valuables if they can't repay their loan. However, it's also a risk for the pawnbroker - in an industry flooded with counterfeit goods, unique items need expert valuation and erratic markets must be navigated, the more valuable the asset the bigger the risk to the pawnbroker.
