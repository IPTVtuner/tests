It's the start of another explosive weekend on the White Isle of Ibiza - and with El Jefe putting pressure on Callum and Tash to come clean over their secret - it's not just the party that's about to go off. Callum remains determined to keep his dirty secret hidden from Riva, but as she is starting to question his interest in her it looks like one way or another it might be the end of the road for them.
