Drew and Jonathan meet Sunita and David, whose overcrowded current home is holding them back. With two kids and no storage space, the house is overrun with toys and David's hobbies. The couple are hoping to find a larger house in their up-and-coming community, but they have just two months to sell before a major financial deadline costs them big money.
