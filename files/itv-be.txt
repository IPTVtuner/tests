Ainsley is pushing the boundaries with a visit to Jordan, a country in the region of the eastern Mediterranean. Ainsley begins his culinary exploration in the capital city of Amman at a bustling fruit and veg market to buy produce for his first recipe, chargrilled sumac lamb cutlets with a herby tabbouleh, which he makes in his stunning outdoor kitchen overlooking the city. Jordan is fast becoming a serious wine producing region, so Ainsley is checking out what one local wine maker has to offer.
