In Seville, Ainsley soaks up the sunshine and visits San Leandro convent, where nuns have been selling homemade sweets to visitors for 400 years. He whips up a charred orange and spiced almond salad before learning about iberico ham from deli owner Elio, and using some in a classic Spanish pork sandwich: serranito de lomo. Ainsley then learns some traditional recipes and takes a romantic boat ride at the Plaza De Espana, before heading to the pop-up kitchen to cook an epic tapas selection.
