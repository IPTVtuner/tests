The parents take part in a workshop where they are encouraged to acknowledge resentments of the past that some of them are struggling to let go of - there are heartfelt moments and revelations, but the workshop also leaves questions when not everyone shares their past. The end of this episode then brings another surprise that also offers hope for some of the parents.
