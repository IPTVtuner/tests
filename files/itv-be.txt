Gino leaves Verona on one of Italy's super-fast trains and heads to the majestic Lake Garda, the biggest of the Italian lakes. Here he meets a team of rowers training for their annual regatta. The race stemmed from the lake's ancient fishing tradition, when the fishermen would race out on their longboats to reach the best fishing spots. After trying his hand at rowing, Gino cooks up a hearty sausage and bean casserole, before jumping on the train and heading north towards the Dolomites.
