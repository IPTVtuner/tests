Chef Gino D'Acampo travels through the north and south of Italy, celebrating the women who have fuelled and fed his fellow Italians through the ages. Gino's birthplace, Torre Del Greco, is nestled at the base of the mighty Mount Vesuvius and edged by the Azure seas off the Gulf of Naples. It's also where he kick-starts his culinary travels across his homeland. Join Gino as he revisits some childhood food favourites in his aunt's kitchens, as well as his old haunts in the seaside town itself.
