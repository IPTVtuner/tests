Ainsley is exploring Corsica, the isle of beauty, and his travels have brought him to the medieval fortress town of Bonifacio, where he learns about the history and culture of the place from tour guide Christine before whipping up some cheesy stuffed aubergines in his stunning outdoor kitchen, which overlooks the harbour. After visiting a local honey producer, he makes honey-glazed pan-roasted figs, served with a Corsican charcuterie platter.
