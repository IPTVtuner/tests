After the Be Well Not Jel festival ended in calamity rather than calm, Dani is more convinced than ever that Gatsby has blamed her for the fallout with Chloe M and Courtney. If this wasn't enough, the news of Gatsby kissing new girl Hannah has made its way to Dani... in spite of a pact they made when they split up not to flaunt any new love interests in front of each other.
