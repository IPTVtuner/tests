There's a naughty secret in the hotel this weekend. After sharing a kiss behind everyone's back last week, Jordan and Chloe have decided to brush the truth under the carpet and try to move on. Jordan is now focused on taking his relationship with Isobel to the next level, while Callum and Chloe are trying to work out just what their relationship is and where it's going. Trainee Savvas has got two of his repping badges.
