Lila still holds a grudge against her high school nemesis Glenn, but he's just moved back into their hometown and got a job at the theatre where Lila works - she wants nothing to do with him, but Glenn claims that he's different now and wants to prove it. When the company has a Secret Santa gift exchange to bring in the Christmas spirit, Glenn swaps assignments to make sure that he is Lila's Secret Santa - and Lila begins to fall for the man she used to resent.
