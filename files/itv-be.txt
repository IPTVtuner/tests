Ferne is still in a daze following her engagement to Lorri and is heading straight to church, but this time it's to celebrate Sunday's christening. Ferne and Sunday also get away on a barging holiday with Carl, Ellis and Sarrah which goes less than smoothly, and Ferne celebrates her birthday with a trip to the safari park with Sunday before Lorri organises a romantic dinner where the couple make huge plans.
