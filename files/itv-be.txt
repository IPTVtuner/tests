The Shepherds are back from their holiday and it's back to reality. Whilst Billie beats her post-holiday blues by hitting The Kings Road for some retail therapy, along with her mum Sue and sister Sam, Greg enlists dad Dave to help spruce up the garden all ready for when Sue moves in. Billie and Greg take to the tennis court in search of a new hobby and talk turns to plans for their big anniversary party.
