After scouring the area of their dreams for a new home, Andy and Ben fell in love with a charming old house - however, having done renovations in the past, they knew that they couldn't tackle this one and needed expert help to turn their classy vision into reality. Things start well but after a series of setbacks, Kortney and Kenny have a limited budget left to create the upscale pad that Andy and Ben are longing for - and also create a fun space for their small daughter Sadie.
