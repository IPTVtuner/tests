Despite having been the golden couple of Essex, it looks like Amber feels left behind and confused - having just turned 29, she is questioning if her relationship with Dan has a future and if it is what she wants any more. They seem to be treading water and are exactly where they were three years ago with no engagement, no wedding, and no baby. Will Dan understand where she's coming from, or will it highlight that they are on very different paths?
