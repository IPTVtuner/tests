It's the second weekend, and El Jefe's team of reps have started to couple up. The next set of guests are on their way, and an old face is about to join the rep team. Much to David's frustration and Jordan's disapproval, `Weekenderville' relationships are blossoming, with Tash and Jaden getting together and Riva and Callum getting closer. Even with the arrival of larger-than-life guests Izzy, Kennady, Alfie and Charlie, there seems little that can upset the rep love-in.
