Ainsley arrives in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh, where he gets stuck into the hustle and bustle of the souk with a visit to Chez Lamine, a small restaurant famous for cooking whole lambs in their underground oven. He makes some quick flat breads with tomato salsa to serve alongside it. Next, he's on the hunt for one of Morocco's most famous ingredients: ras el hanout, so it's off to Mellah spice souk for a bit of shopping.
