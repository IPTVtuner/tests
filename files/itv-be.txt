The group head off for a well-earned break in sunny Bali. Dani feels guilty for keeping a secret from Harry but, as the two get closer, will she tell him? Meanwhile, Chloe and Jordan have noticed Junaid is isolating himself and spending all of his time with Joe. They chat to Junaid and explain how changing his behaviour would help the group move forward. Elsewhere, Diags is determined to have a good time in Bali and wants to forget about his problems.
