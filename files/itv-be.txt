The festive spirit has arrived and despite restrictions being put on the country, our Essex friends are determined to make the best from a not-so-great situation. Amy is keen for daughter Polly to get a taste of what Christmas is normally like and turns her home into a Winter Wonderland. Meanwhile, Tommy has a big Christmas surprise for Georgia, who has had her decorations up since Bonfire Night, and Ella has something to tell Tom, but how will he react to her news?
