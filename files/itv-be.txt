It's another fun-filled day in Singletown, and Joel has sent his Citysiders on a party bike sight-seeing tour around London. Meanwhile, Riversiders Elliot, Claudia, Selin, Luke and George chill-out at home with a much-needed pamper session. The reality of being unattached begins to hit home as our 10 separated singles realise it's not only fun and flirting for them - their exes are doing the same thing. And they're starting to miss their other halves.
