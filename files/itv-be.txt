As the camping trip draws to a close, Dan and Ella discuss Freddie as Dan has had enough of him being a third wheel and wants to find him a man - elsewhere, Diags is starting to have doubts about Jodie moving to Essex and confesses that he may have jumped the gun asking her to move to Essex while adding that he hadn't thought about the logistics of her moving with Bear. Jodie understands where Diags is coming from, but he needs him to make more of an effort.
