James and Elizabeth's young family are world travellers and have never owned a real home - after deciding that it was time to settle down, they purchased a massive house in the nicest community, but it also had to be the most outdated for them to afford it. Kortney understands what it is like to have three small children, so she enlists Kenny's help to open up the walls and make room for this growing family.
