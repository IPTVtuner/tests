It's week two in Singletown and the residents of the Riverside apartment are living their best single lives after nearly all of them bagged themselves a date at yesterday's boat party. Back on dry land, Claudia takes Bailey sky high on their one-to-one date and Selin lets her guard down with smooth talking David at dinner.
