Odessa and Shannon moved into their newly-built home in 2005 with dreams of planting roots and living a cosy family life - however, Hurricane Katrina then hit, and this young couple ended up taking in 29 house guests who had lost their own homes in the natural disaster. The house now remains a shrine to that crazy part of their lives, but with their first daughter going off to college, the couple want to snap out of the past and jump into the future with Kortney and Kenny's help.
