Gino reaches the unique town of Alberobello with its cone-shaped Truili houses. Here he learns about the history of these iconic homes and gets a lesson in making the local pasta orecchiette from a Nona in her back garden. Next, Gino heads to the city of Lecce. Here he finds out about the local tradition of cartapesta - or papier mache. Leaving Lecce, Gino returns to the coast to create a chicken skewers dish with a sticky marinade and a healthy bean and fennel salad.
