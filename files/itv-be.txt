A brand-new couple are welcomed to Singletown as exes Meg and Nat arrive and kick off their residency in style. Following a breakup that leaves them both broken-hearted, they're thrown straight into the dating deep-end when Joel and Emily organise each of them a first night first date. After last night's emotional Love Locket Ceremony, the rest of our singletons are determined to enjoy their single status.
