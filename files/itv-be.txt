The dating season continues into its second day at The Cabins, where one dater has the difficult task of making the day romantic-without-being-romantic - so turns to some sheep for help... The heat is on in one Cabin as one guest takes control, and it's a day full of firsts for a new check-in next door. After karaoke, some snogging, an honest confession, and an emotional confrontation, which couples will be checking out, and which will be continuing their romance for another 24 hours?
