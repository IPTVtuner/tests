Gino visits the jewel of the Italian Riviera - the Cinque Terre. Only accessible by boat or by train, these five breathtaking towns cling to the cliff edges and offer a truly magical rail journey along the Mediterranean. His first stop brings him to the smallest town, Corniglia, to meet an opera singing florist on market day before hopping back on the train to Manarola.
