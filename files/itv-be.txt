Sometimes, opposites attract - but will today's daters find their differences too hard to overcome? Mixed messages are being sent in one cabin, and it becomes a family affair when a sister of one dater arrives for her own cabin date. Meanwhile, another couple is busy writing their very own love story alongside some cocktail making and a sensuous massage.
