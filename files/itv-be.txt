Sam and Billie team up for the final show of the series. The Shepherd's holiday in Spain comes to an end but Billie and Greg are worried as Nelly gets the back to school blues. Back in Hertfordshire, Sam and Paul get offered their first ever clothing collaboration and Sam is hoping that camera shy Paul will want to do it. Fashionista daughter Rosie helps Mum at a bespoke dress fitting and Sam flies to Lisbon for a photo shoot but has no idea she's swapping children for animals.
