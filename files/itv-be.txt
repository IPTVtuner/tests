After the dramatic and tense end to the double birthday bash the housewives are all shellshocked. Tessa takes time out from petty much everyone, and her friends Mia and Karen try to help lift her back up. Whilst Ashley and Margaret's friendship is made even stronger with a trip to a baby scan, Ashley is unaware that her comments at the party have made Tessa feel even worse. Jersey has ever seen.
