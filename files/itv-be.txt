Billie and Greg attempt to restore some order with the introduction of chores that see the kids learning about the value of money, but not everyone is on board with the idea - meanwhile, Greg and Paul join Billie and Sam on their podcast and reveal some shocking secrets and parenting clashes, Nelly's continued interest in make-up causes Billie to decide to take her shopping, and Greg throws an extravagant cowboy-themed party where a cheeky prank leaves him hot under the collar.
