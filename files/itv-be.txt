Tanya and Gabriella take a trip to London where they have a glamorous night out at the Metro Pride Awards, but they first have to get ready in the not-so-glamorous back of their cab - elsewhere, Gabriella considers having breast surgery, Phil is left to oversee basement renovations, and Tanya tries to get Julie fit with a personal trainer in a session that doesn't quite go to plan.
