The Shepherds are in full holiday mode as they head off to sunny Portugal. Billie and Greg might be looking forward to a well-earned break, but will Arthur bring his challenging behaviour all the way from Brentwood to Portugal? Whilst making memories and soaking up the sun, Billie juggles work and family life even on holiday, whilst Greg unveils his two-year plan to best friend Johny.
