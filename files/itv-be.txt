The Shepherds are heading to Abu Dhabi for their first work trip abroad as a family of five - and it's extra-special as it's Margot's first-ever holiday. Billie and Greg battle with the trials and tribulations of travelling with a 10-week-old, and it's a family affair as sister Sam and their mother Sue joins with her family as well - while there, the kids have fun in the sun with their cousins on a camel and Margot takes her first dip in a swimming pool.
