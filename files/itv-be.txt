With two chairs left empty at Seema's dinner party, the question all of the Housewives are left asking is where Hanna and Rachel are in Edinburgh. As the pair come to terms with the shock news of Hanna's pregnancy, they have to decide whether to face their frenemies or take the easy option and avoid them at all costs, but will a no-show just make matters worse for the pair?
