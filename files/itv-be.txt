Five couples are choosing to press pause on their relationships and spend one incredible summer experiencing single life. Having said farewell to their other halves, our freshly uncoupled singletons begin their month of fun by moving into two swanky multi-million-pound flats on the banks of the Thames. As the residents of each flat get to know each other and settle into their surroundings, two surprise guests drop by - Emily Atack and Joel Dommett, Singletown's mentors.
