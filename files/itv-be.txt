The legendary Real Housewives of Cheshire reunion is back and better than ever! To celebrate this highly-anticipated 150th episode Brian Dowling is on hand to find out whether it's Seasons Greetings, or a case of frost-bitten friendships for our glamourous girls. From boxing to babygate, motherhood to menopause and facelifts to 50ths, nothing is off limits. So, grab yourself a mince pie, pour some eggnog and hold onto your crackers as we unwrap it all.
