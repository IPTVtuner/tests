As the kids' behaviour fails to improve, Billie and Greg wonder if their constant snacking could be a factor - however, when they attempt to fix the problem, the pair end up having to take drastic measures to stop them raiding the pantry. Elsewhere, Chatty celebrates his 70th birthday as the family try to keep his surprise party a secret from him while ensuring that people show up, and Billie jets off for a swimwear shoot in Marrakech that leaves Greg home alone on daddy duties with the kids.
