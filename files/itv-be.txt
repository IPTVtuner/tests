Hilarious and touching reality series where Tanya Bardsley and her family open the doors to their life. Tanya has been dealing with quite a few health issues lately around the perimenopause and so has booked in with a gynaecologist to check whether she should have a hysterectomy or not - meanwhile, Tanya and Julie try out a sound bath before the day of Tanya's big charity event Mental Mummies, hosted by Jenny Powell, where the great and glitterati of Cheshire are coming.
