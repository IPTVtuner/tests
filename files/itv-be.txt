It's the last leg of Ainsley's epic exploration of the Mediterranean, and he's continuing his travels across the Middle Eastern country of Jordan. In the south sits the seaside city of Aqaba, where Ainsley meets a local family who show him how to make date molasses that he uses in his fabulous fattoush salad. He then meets and cooks with chefs from a snazzy golf club restaurant in the Ayla resort, where roasted fish with spicy rice is the order of the day.
