Head rep David has decided to treat himself, believing his team is bonding well. But even El Jefe's new do will not change the fact that two of his reps are sitting on a secret that could blow the entire team apart. The big secret of Tash and Callum's horizontal tangoing is still hanging over them, Tash feels awkward as she is starting to really like Jaden and she doesn't know what to do. Callum doesn't want to tell anyone. Especially as he's still getting close to Riva - and his ex has arrived.
