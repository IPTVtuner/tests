Tanya is back with a blast from the past that gets Lauren feeling nostalgic for a classic girls' night out while Ell finally spills the beans about her baby news. However, it's a rumoured voice note that creates the biggest shockwaves and causes Paige and Seema to collide over fiery accusations. Lauren tries to distract with dancing and drag queens, but a game of `Never Have I Ever' leaves jaws on the floor and a friendship in tatters.
