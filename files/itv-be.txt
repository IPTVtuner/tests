The Cabins returns with a fresh batch of hopeful singletons checking in for the ultimate 24-hour blind date. With the luxurious log cabins physically closer together, and new romantic spaces to explore this year, three new pairs will experience a new and unique search for love. There are tears, laughter, heartfelt conversations and more. When the 24 hours are up they'll each have a big decision to make: who will be extending their stay, and whose date will be brought to an end?
