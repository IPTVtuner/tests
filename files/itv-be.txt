It's the start of another season on the party island of Ibiza and with the holidaymakers making ready for a summer of fun. El Jefe, David, is back and along with his new pet, fish Jenna, is joined by the experienced team of Jordan, Callum and Tash, but before the first set of guests arrive two new reps are introduced to the team and are put through their paces. Luckily Callum and Tash are more than happy to welcome wholesome Welsh Riva and London joker Jaden to the team.
