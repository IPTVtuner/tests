After a series of ups and downs, Roman and Dani finally seem on track to being loved up. Harry on the other hand is having second thoughts after seeing some red flags with Junaid and is worried he is leading him on. At the Sugar Hut, an excited Junaid makes a beeline for Harry, but is surprised when he informs him that he isn't feeling it and doesn't think they should see each other romantically anymore.
