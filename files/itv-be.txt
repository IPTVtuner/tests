It's the end of an era: Dan Edgar's bachelor pad, scene of some of the most infamous after-parties in Essex, is closing its doors and being re-launched in a new guise. It's now Dan and Amber's flat, and she's wasted no time in adding some female flourishes: Dan's about to swap nights on the Xbox with Diags for couples' dinner parties, but before he does, he invites the lads over to say goodbye to the flat properly.
