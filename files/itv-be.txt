Following the adventures of The Dreamettes, an all-girl singing group. They're going nowhere fast until they meet fast-talking car salesman-come-manager who has ambitions to make a fortune selling black music to a white audience. He persuades them to become backing singers for James `Thunder' Early, but the larger-than-life lead singer Effie White must step out of the spotlight in favour of the more image-friendly Deena Jones.
