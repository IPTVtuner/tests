Tanya decides that the family needs a bit of quality time together and so surprises them with a trip to Blackpool, but the first hurdle is getting there and Rocco is taking a lot of convincing to even leave the house. Tanya has booked two motorhomes for the Bardsleys to travel and stay at a campsite in, but this is met with a few mixed reactions from the family.
