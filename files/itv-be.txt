Life is action-packed as always in the McCann household as Ferne tries to juggle a hectic workload with being a mum to Sunday and a bit of me time - as she prepares for her most risque shoot yet, her new team is on hand to help organise things, so there's time to work hard and play hard. After a successful shoot, Ferne heads off into the Kent countryside for a spot of glamping with Sunday and her besties, then helps Grandad to fulfil a lifelong dream as they take to the skies in a glider plane.
