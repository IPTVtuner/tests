Amy Walsh is taking daughter Bonnie to Prague to see her husband Toby acting in a feature film - travelling with a two-year-old on her own isn't plain sailing, but meeting the ultimate drama queen Joan Collins is a highlight! Elsewhere, Lucy Fallon, Brooke Vincent and a host of Coronation Street stars go to watch Ellie Leach perform on stage in Manchester.
