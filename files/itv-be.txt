Kelvin and his family continue their farming journey in the Peak District, but their lambing season is full of challenges this year as Kelvin goes through a devastating loss when a three-day-old lamb breaks her leg - it's also time for the pigs to go to auction, but Kelvin may struggle to make a return on his investment with prices at an all-time low. Elsewhere, Liz tries to get hands-on with the cows but is convinced that they don't like her after a close encounter with a calf.
