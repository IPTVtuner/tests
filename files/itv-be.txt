Ferne looks for a hobby for daughter Sunday and gives ice skating a try herself with former team GB ice hockey player and best friend Ellis. Ferne gets parenting advice from a professional, starts a sticker chart with Sunday and with school on the horizon, decides it's time to leave Bun Bun at home. After a boxing class with fitness trainer Ellie, Ferne discusses the new man in her life... God. Both girls head to church for a chat with the Reverend Father Matthew.
