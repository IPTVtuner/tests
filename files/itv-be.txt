A subway ticket clerk's life changes when she goes to the aid of a handsome commuter she has worshipped from afar. When he is knocked off the platform during a mugging, she drags him from the path of an oncoming train, and in the confusion is assumed to be his fianc√©e. Then when she is embraced by the comatose man's family, she finds herself carried along by unlikely events.
