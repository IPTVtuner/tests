Great! Action
Today, January 01
Two trigger-happy cowboy mercenaries head for Mexico during the 1866 revolution. A pair of beautiful women try to persuade them to fight for rival armies, but they eventually side with the Emperor Maximilian, tempted by the consignment of gold that they have been hired to escort. Inevitably, revolutionary fervour and double-dealing point the way to a violent confrontation.
