Great! Action
Today, April 13
During fighting, Sergeant Michael Dunne of the Canadian `Fighting Tenth' battalion is wounded in action and returned home to Calgary. Diagnosed as neurasthenic, he is honourably discharged and put to work in recruiting troops for the front. When David, the foolish, asthmatic younger brother of Michael's beloved nurse Sarah tries to enlist, Michael sends him away. However, David is persistent.
