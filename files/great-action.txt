Tom Craig is a mild-mannered druggist from Boston who opens a shop in wild and woolly Sacramento shortly before the Gold Rush. The town is `owned' by the Dawson brothers, Britt and Joe, who poison Craig's tonic when saloon hostess Lacey Miller takes too much of an interest in the handsome newcomer. Town drunk Whitey has one drink too many, and all of Sacramento is soon in a lynching mood.
