World War II drama about a US army major in charge of an eight-man demolition team in eastern China. The squad races against the clock to blow up strategically vital bridges against the advance of the Japanese army. When the destruction of one mountain bridge leaves thousands of Chinese homeless, the major - at first indifferent to their plight - is forced to question where his real duty lies.
