Great! Action
Today, September 18
In the arid wilderness of Oregon in 1845, the voluble Stephen Meek has persuaded his fellow travellers that he knows a short cut and so, keen to lessen the grim rigours of their trek through the harsh landscape, the small band have left the established trail. Slowly it dawns upon the pioneers that their water will run our long before Meek's self-confidence, and it's at this point that they run across a Cayuse tribesman.
