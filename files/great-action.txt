Today, November 19
Roy Parmenter is an FBI agent in San Diego. Twenty years earlier his partner was killed by a soviet spy, nicknamed Scuba, still at large. Scuba is now trying to extort the Soviets; to prove he's serious, he's killing their agents one by one, including `sleepers', agents under deep cover awaiting orders.
