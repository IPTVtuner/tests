A motley crew of men and women set out in search of a canyon full of gold - pursued by Apaches and the cavalry. A sheriff is entrusted with a treasure map by a dying Indian, which he burns after committing it to memory. His secret holds out a promise of untold wealth, if he can trace the legendary lost canyon, but also makes him the target of ruthless fortune hunters.
