Great! Action
Today, November 04
A band of treasure seekers search for a wagon train full of gold that had been buried years before somewhere in Death Valley. Of course, the closer the group gets to the gold, the higher the tension among them gets until several members of the party are killed. When a vicious sandstorm kicks up, the remaining treasure hunters scatter, but the winds reveal the location of the gold.
