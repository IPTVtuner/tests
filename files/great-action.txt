Great! Action
Today, December 04
An emotional and harrowing re-creation of the battle to secure Hill 937 in the Ashau Valley during the Vietnam War. The film follows a platoon through eleven agonising assaults over a ten-day period, suffering rivers of mud, stifling heat and driving rain as they battle against a well-entrenched enemy. This searing account of one battle can be seen as a microcosm of the Vietnam War itself.
