Set in Mexico in 1916, a major branded a coward by his disgruntled commanding officer who bears a grudge because of his own failure to rise in the ranks. He sends the major and a party on a suicide mission into the desert, knowing full well they are unlikely to survive. Instead, the major displays his real strength, and eventually gains the respect of the seemingly doomed expedition.
