Today, October 05
A cavalry captain is responsible for keeping the peace between Native Americans and white people, but his efforts are undermined by a pair of gold speculators, whose underhanded activities spark an uprising amongst the Native Americans. The captain is placed under house arrest, but escapes and must race against time to prevent an all-out massacre.
