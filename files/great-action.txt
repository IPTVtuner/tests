Great! Action

Espionage thriller about a plot to make America appear responsible for a communist nuclear strike on North Korea. A submarine commander leads a secret mission to the Arctic to check reports that Russia is assembling a nuclear arsenal on a remote island. The film is so virulently anti-communist that even a British critic called it a "disgrace and an insult".
