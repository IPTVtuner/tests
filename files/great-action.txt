In the early 1800s in Indiana, competing US and British forces fight to win territory from the native Shawnee Indians. The local governor enlists the aid of a missionary, whose friendship with the Shawnee chief Tecumseh goes back to childhood, but Tecumseh's leadership of the Shawnee is contested by his brother, known as The Prophet, who sides with the British.
