Today, April 13
Borrowing widely from Nunally Johnson's script for Henry King's 1939 version of the legend (and using two sequences from the same production), Nicholas Ray's version portrays Jesse James as a rebel rather than a simple outlaw, driven to a life of crime by Northern sympathisers after the Civil War as the film follows the last 18 years of his life.
