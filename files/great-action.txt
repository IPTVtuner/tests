Great! Action
Today, April 19
A middle-aged cowhand runs into a gang of thieves and a beautiful woman as he searches for work. He finds himself drawn to the woman who is heading toward Oregon to join her husband on his farm. Despite his reluctance to make any inappropriate move, the cowboy forms a bond with the woman that may prove hard to break.
