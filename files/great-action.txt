When a rookie patrolman in a US border town mistakenly kills the Mexican illegal immigrant Melquiades Estrada, he hastily buries him in the desert. When the body is found, his friend Pete Perkins kidnaps the patrolman and takes him with him on a journey across the border, to bury Melquiades in his home town.
