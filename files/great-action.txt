Great! Action
Today, March 11
Drug-dealing delinquent Johnny Truelove lives the high life in LA, partying with his peers and getting a steady dope supply from dad Sonny. However, when a dangerous customer refuses to pay, Johnny and right-hand man Frankie kidnap the junkie's younger brother, intending only to keep the kid hidden and happy until they get the cash. These would-be gangsters find themselves out of their depth when the police get involved.
