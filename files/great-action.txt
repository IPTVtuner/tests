Historical epic depicting the battle of the Alamo in 1836, where 183 Texans were besieged in an abandoned mission by a Mexican army of nearly 2,000 men and fought to the last man. The Alamo is a central part of America's national myth, and with a historical cast, it provides entertaining patriotism on a grand scale.
