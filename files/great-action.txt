Great! Action
Today, March 16
A Texas Ranger is in pursuit of a gang of vicious outlaws who are running guns and whiskey to the Comanches. The gang's megalomaniac leader is a renegade Confederate officer who has hatched an evil scheme to build an empire in Mexico, using the Comanches to attack the Union. The Ranger, assisted only by a local gambler, takes on the powerful outlaw and his henchmen.
