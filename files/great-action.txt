Great! Action
Today, March 18
A soldier turned pacifist, recently returned from a bloody war, is forced into a confrontation with a bullying cattle baron. The disabled cattleman uses violence and scare tactics to push out smaller ranchers and farmers. He is so involved in his evil pursuits, he fails to notice the love affair being carried on by his wife and brother.
