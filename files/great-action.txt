At Christmas in 1944, the Germans make one final push against the attacking allied armies in the west. Lt Robert Cappa and his platoon of 2nd Infantry Division soldiers are ordered to hold a vital road junction against the German aggressors and must somehow find the strength to stand against their enemy in the fight known as `The Battle of the Bulge'.
