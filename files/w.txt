When Smithy finds a cab driver badly beaten with his takings missing, an Oyster card found nearby leads them to Ellie Gladstone. Officers speak to a cagey Ellie, who denies all knowledge of the crime, but Kezia later discovers Ellie lied to them. They question her again at a support centre run by Leanne Samuels, whose daughter was caught in the crossfire of a gangland drive-by a year earlier.
