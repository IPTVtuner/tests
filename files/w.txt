Two couples prove that unplanned pregnancies can happen at very different ages. Andy, who's 41, and Nina, who's 39, thought they'd long left nappies and sleepless nights behind. Jonathan, who's 21, met 18-year-old Laura when he randomly sent her a message on a social networking site. Three months later she fell pregnant.
