Expecting her first baby is Charlotte, one of the Leeds General Infirmary's midwives. Charlotte and her husband James have been together for nine years, married for one and fell pregnant quickly, even though Charlotte has polycystic ovaries. Charlotte is very passionate about her job and hopes that her own birth experience will help her care more sensitively for women in childbirth.
