The team investigate when an abandoned car is found with traces of blood nearby. The car belongs to Ajay Kapur, but his family claim that he flew to India earlier that day. The officers keep digging, and find that Mr Kapur did not go to India - and that he was being followed. Mrs Kapur eventually admits that her husband has been kidnapped. The police organise a sting to get him back, but will the operation go smoothly?
