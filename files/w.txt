It's Christmas and Miranda would like a relaxing and fun time without her parents. After Penny's Best Christmas Jumper Party, Miranda and Stevie try to spend Christmas at the shop with Gary, Clive and Tilly. However, after online present shopping doesn't arrive, an infuriating encounter at the post office, a run-in with some carol singers and a couple of arguments with friends, maybe Christmas would be better with her family.
