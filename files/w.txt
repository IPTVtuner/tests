Hanna and Mike have three kids, two of them are twins born prematurely. One now suffers from cerebral palsy and the other is profoundly deaf. The family house is tiny and the cramped conditions are making life extremely difficult and at times dangerous for the growing boys. Nick Knowles and DIY SOS team call on friends, family and the local community to come to the aid of this young family and build a single storey extension in just nine days.
