This time, the mystery surrounds Clare and her partner John, who live in Guildford. Trying to pass themselves off as the lady of the manor are one Clare who has a moment over a watering can, a Klara from Slovakia who says most people think she is the cleaner not the homeowner, a former air hostess who met John on a flight, and another Clare who claims to have been living in the property all her life.
