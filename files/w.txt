Sally and Callum visit Mandy Glover, the victim of an assault in a park. Back at Sun Hill, Kezia compiles a list of sex offenders and is shocked to see the name of Kevin Mallory - a man she arrested for rape when she was a PC. The team decide that Sally should go undercover, working in the same bar as Mandy - who is set upon again while walking home. The officers eventually discover who the real attacker is.
