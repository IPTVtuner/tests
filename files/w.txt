Officers are called out to a house where a young woman, Zoe Richards, has been found unconscious. Following a search, it becomes clear that the place is a brothel and that Zoe and her two housemates are prostitutes. Dylan Prest, a known drug dealer and pimp, turns up to see Zoe in hospital and says he is her boyfriend. Although the police know Dylan has been abusing the girls, they have to release him and end the investigation.
