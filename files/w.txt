Single mother Julie Jones became a national news story when she promised to look after her dying friend's children. Overnight Julie's family grew from three children to eight. Nick Knowles and the team travel to Huntingdon where, with the help of the local community, they aim to transform Julie's house into a home for this supersized family. They have just ten days in which to finish the build.
