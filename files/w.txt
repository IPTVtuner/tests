Stacey meets 75-year-old Bill who, like a million of us in the UK, has grown up without any contact with his father. Bill was born at the end of World War II after his mum fell in love with his dad, an African American GI stationed at her local Leicestershire airbase. He returned to the US at the end of the war and she never heard from him again. The only information Bill has ever had about his father is the name written on his birth certificate.
