Sgt Callum Stone is on his way home from a night out when he sees couple Clarinda Blake and Tim Hardacre arguing in an alley. When Tim starts to hit Clarinda, Callum goes to her defence but gets a severe beating in return. Clarinda is traced and questioned but insists she was the victim of a random mugging. It emerges that Clarinda's teenage son Andy had been dealing weed for Tim and when Clarinda found out, she confronted him.
