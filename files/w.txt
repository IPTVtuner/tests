Nigel Slater shows how, with a little forward planning, all the stress can be taken out of cooking. Cooking after a busy day at work is often the last thing you want to do, but Nigel inspires us with a range of dishes that can be easily adapted throughout the week. Nigel also visits James and Melissa, whose London Barge is an oasis of fruit and veg.
