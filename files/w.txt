Two strong-willed first-time mums give birth at Leeds General Infirmary. Alexandra is naming her baby boy Rupert after the actor Rupert Everett "because he's so handsome". She left her native Latvia in search of adventure and ended up in Leeds. Surbhi is from the warrior Hindu caste and knows what she wants. Her husband, Kaushik, who's from a caste of philosophers, will do anything to please her.
