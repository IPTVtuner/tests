Jo and Benjamin get a call out to a hotel where Mark Pierce is demanding to be let in, claiming that his wife Julia is staying there. In her room, a man called Alan Marsh is lying badly injured while Julia has disappeared. She is later cleared when forensic results show that she is not the culprit, but how does Julia know the real attacker - Craig Chapman?
