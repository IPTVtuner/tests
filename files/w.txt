A young woman, Tina Wilson, is attacked in a park. When she is questioned in hospital by Phil and Grace, she tells them that she spent the day in a casino and her handbag with her winnings had been taken. The bag is found - with a bloodied knife, covered in her prints. Then, the detectives discover a link between one of the casino barmen and a taxi driver. Elsewhere, Callum and Dan are called out to a domestic dispute.
