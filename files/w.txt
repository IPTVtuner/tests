Miranda has spent most of her life avoiding being set up by her mother Penny. Old school pal Tilly sets her up on a blind date with an army doctor friend, Dreamboat Charlie. The date doesn't go quite to plan and so Penny insists on throwing a party to introduce Miranda to a suitable man. When Miranda sees a photo of her intended date he's so bad that the only option left is to lie and to come out to her mother.
