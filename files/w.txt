Sally and Emma discover Linda Mazvidza badly beaten. Her partner suggests that the attack may be racist as she is an asylum seeker, but her son is found with a bag of passports which she has been selling. Then the boy is snatched by his violent father - who is high up in the Zimbabwean government. Gina is shocked to find that one of the passports belongs to a bank robber who was thought to have died in 1988.
