DI Neil Manson and DS Max Carter investigate when 17-year-old Ashley Simmons is found shot dead and dumped in a warehouse. Their enquiries lead them to the children's home where she once lived, but friends and family there all claim that she was a clean-living teen. Evidence points to Ashley's mother's boyfriend, whose car was spotted at the crime scene.
