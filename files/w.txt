Jan and Lucy have five wonderful kids: Hadley, Kenneth and triplet daughters Lola, Daisy and Amber. Complications before the triplets were born have left two of them living with nephrotic syndrome, a disease that causes kidney failure and requires them to have 70 hours of dialysis each week. The nearest hospital that offers the service they need is a four-hour round trip away, and with the girls scheduled for treatment on different days, it means Jan and Lucy are constantly in the car driving.
