The registered owner of an abandoned car, Simon Winstanley, confirms that a mobile phone found at the scene belongs to his missing wife, Ella. The last call made on it was to her personal trainer, Craig Blundell. When Callum and Will call at Craig's flat, they find him stabbed and Ella in a state of shock - and prints on a knife that prove to be Simon's.
