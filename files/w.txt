Nick Knowles and the team enlist the help of the local community in Aberystwyth to renovate a home for a builder with a brain tumour. Michael Saunders built an extension onto his house when his son- in-law's MS meant he had to start using a wheelchair. When Michael discovered he had cancer, he was unable to finish his own home and he and his partner were left living in a cold and draughty shell of a house.
