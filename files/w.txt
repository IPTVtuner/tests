There's tension at Birmingham Women's Hospital fetal medicine centre, as 19-year-old Billie-Joe has surgery to save her baby daughter while she is still in the womb. Billie-Joe's twin pregnancy has developed TRAP sequence, which means one of the twins hasn't developed properly and has no heartbeat. We also meet first-time mum Mini, who is less then five feet tall, and her partner Connor, a six-foot powerlifter.
