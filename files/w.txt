Kirsty and Leon decide to put the evening down to a one night stand after a traumatic day. Then Leon and Nate find a woman, Jane Connor, badly injured next to an abandoned car. Jodie Knox, suspected of being a passenger, is arrested. Under questioning she names Ashley Johnson as the driver and he is brought in, but Leon, wound up from the previous day, has to be stopped from hitting him.
