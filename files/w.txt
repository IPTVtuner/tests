Stacey Dooley introduces four people who all claim to own the same house and be the same person. Only one of them is telling the truth; the other three are actors, and celebrity panel Bill Bailey, Emily Atack, Judi Love, Jamali Maddix and guest panelist Jimmy Carr must sniff out the true homeowner. Today's homeowner is Gemma, who lives with her partner Pete and her two children in Farnham, Surrey.
