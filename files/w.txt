The main suspect in the murder of Carly Samuels, Tito Morientes, turns up at the teenager's funeral. Then a gunshot rings out and the glass on the hearse shatters. As the police desperately try to control the crowds and the funeral goes ahead, Leanne's words about her daughter appear to have an effect on Alisha Danniels - Tito's alibi. Back at the station, Alisha is questioned again and finally reveals the murderer.
