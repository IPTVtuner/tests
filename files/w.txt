Sarah Sanderson met her current partner Jamie in a pub and challenged him to a drinking competition, which she won. He is a massive rugby fan and hopes they will be having a boy and has already bought the baby several Leeds Rhino replica outfits. He has no idea how he'd bring up a girl, with the sex of the baby still unknown. The last time she was pregnant she delivered a stillborn baby at 22 weeks.
