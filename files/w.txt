An investigation is mounted when four-year-old Billy Sullivan goes missing from his father's garden. When CCTV footage comes to light showing Billy getting into a car, the officers start tracing the vehicle, but DS Stevie Moss and DC Jacob Banks soon discover that the number plates are false. They track the car to a local scrap yard and learn that the plates were sold to Peter Grigson, so the team set out to find him.
