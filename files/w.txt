Neil is furious when his informant fails to warn him about a robbery where the thieves got away with Â£500,000 in jewellery. One of the owners of the shop is revealed to be in serious debt - supporting Neil's theory that the heist was an inside job. During the investigation, Mickey and Terry identify two other suspects and discover the stolen jewellery - only to have a gun held to their heads.
