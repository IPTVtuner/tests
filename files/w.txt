Steff, 19, has come into hospital with her boyfriend Matt. She never expected to get pregnant after being diagnosed with cysts on her ovaries but is looking forward to being a mum. During labour, her baby's heart rate dips dramatically and the doctor decides she needs a category-one emergency caesarean or forceps delivery, which means she needs to go under general anaesthetic. Plus, Katrina needs to be induced.
