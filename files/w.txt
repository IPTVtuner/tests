Callum and Leela are called to an assault, and discover a prostitute who has been badly beaten by one of her clients. Upon further investigation, they are frustrated to learn that he is an Eastern European diplomat with full immunity, and resolve to find something stronger to charge him with. Elsewhere, Grace and Phil investigate the case of a missing painting, and their investigation leads them to the artist's ex-lover.
