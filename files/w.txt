When PC Nate Roberts and PC Benjamin Gayle are caught up in a shooting, Inspector Dale Smith and Sergeant Jo Masters are called to begin an investigation. An eye witness claims he saw a car speeding off, and the car's owner, Malcolm Christie, is brought in for questioning. However, when little forensic evidence is found on the car, the police are forced to let Christie go.
