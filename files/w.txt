The team are on the trail of Nigel Wren who has been grooming young girls online, posing as a 13-year-old. When Jacob and Terry enter Wren's home to put a trace on his internet activity, they discover he has made an arrangement to meet teenager Kelli Sutton. Believing that the rendezvous is at Waterloo, the officers deploy there, find Wren and arrest him - but there is no sign of Kelli.
