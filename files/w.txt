Nigella decamps to the countryside for a cosy Christmas. She throws a party, serving platters of devilled eggs and a sparkling cocktail, and creates a feast of roast duck with orange, soy and ginger alongside garlic and parmesan mashed potato gratin and sour-sweet soused red cabbage with cranberries.
