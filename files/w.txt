When `One Born' first met Charlie and Dan, Charlie had recently given birth to identical twin girls. Born dangerously premature at just 23 weeks, Baby Mia didn't survive and her sister Isobel was left fighting for life. When Sara and Mark met they already had four teenage children between them. `One Born' first met them when they were expecting their second baby together.
