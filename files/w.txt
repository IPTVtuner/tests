Miranda and Stevie compete to be best friends with the new waitress at the restaurant, Tamara. The trouble is Tamara is 22 and they both find keeping up with an energetic 20 something surprisingly tiring. Their age becomes an issue after an art class, followed by all night karaoke, followed by a swimming experience that puts Miranda face to face with her nudity issues.
