Following up on his 2007 documentary, `The Most Hated Family in America', Louis Theroux returns to Topeka, Kansas, for a week-long visit with the Westboro Baptist Church. He again joins the Phelps family on their controversial pickets where they antagonise communities with offensive slogans. However, four years on from Louis's last visit, there are signs of disarray in the Phelps clan.
