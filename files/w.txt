Nigella Lawson reveals a secret passion for one of the tastes of Italy with her dark and deviant liquorice pudding, before introducing us to the joys of fregola - the Sardinian sun dried and toasted couscous. Nigella's dinner party guests are served a simple yet sumptuous meal of butterflied leg of lamb and baby aubergines with oregano and roasted red onion. Dessert is an irresistible meringue gelato cake.
