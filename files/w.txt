Nigella Lawson loves Christmas and for her a party is the perfect way to celebrate. She kicks off festivities with a glittering buffet party. For her Italian inspiration, Nigella travels to Venice - a city that has been close to her heart ever since her first visit 20 years ago. Armed with recipe and party ideas for her festive feast, Nigella returns to create a tasty Christmas buffet menu for her guests.
