Today, November 25
Katy Taylor, arrested for possession of grass, gives Beth the name of her supplier, Craig McKee. They all attend a party together, where Lenny Jones, a pirate radio DJ, takes a shine to the young undercover officer. There is a raid and Craig is arrested. Outside, Lenny gives Beth his number and kisses her passionately. Back at the station, Craig admits he works for Earl but tells the officers they should be speaking with Lenny.
