This edition features two couples who have stuck together despite the challenges life has thrown at them. Ryan started dating Keely when they were both at school, but to their shock Keely fell pregnant very quickly. Katie says she is the grown up in the relationship and her fianc√© Steve is like a child. In the delivery suite, Steve is on form constantly mucking about and generally driving Katie up the wall.
