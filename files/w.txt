This episode features two very different approaches to childbirth. Olga doesn't want her husband anywhere near her during labour, whilst Vicki keeps her man close at hand. Olga doesn't speak any English, and without her husband in the room, she struggle to communicate with the midwives. Bubbly couple Vicki and Ben celebrate their love with tattoos, and their main worry is that he might run out of space for more.
