Preena and Neet are expecting their second child. Preena has polycystic ovaries, so the couple didn't think they'd ever be able to have children. Fortunately, Preena gave birth to a son and she's now pregnant again and this time due to have a girl. Almost at term, she is told she may have to have her labour induced as she has been experiencing bleeding throughout her pregnancy. Junior doctor Rich and yoga teacher Roo have their hearts set on a water birth at Birmingham Women's Hospital.
