19 Kids and Counting follows the fascinating lives of Britain's largest family, the Radfords, as they take parenting to a whole new level. The cameras return to the family home as Lancashire pie-maker Noel, Sue and the kids prepare to welcome a new baby to their ever growing brood and only weeks later set off on their most ambitious family holiday to date, down under. In Australia, the Radfords meet Australia's biggest family, the Bonnells, who have 16 kids but enforce much stricter house rules.
