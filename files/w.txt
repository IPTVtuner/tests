Georgina was conceived 34 years ago when her mum had a holiday romance with a Portuguese waiter. She's now wondering if her father is still alive. Matthew grew up never knowing his father's identity and wants to know if his ancestry is actually Caribbean. Michaela and Richie only realised they could pass down the genetic disorder `bubble boy disease' when they had their son Arlo. Now they're testing their second child's DNA to discover if he has to undergo life-saving gene therapy.
