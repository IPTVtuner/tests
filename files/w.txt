Today, March 12
It's not an ordinary Sunday for NSW Ambulance as eighty thousand people hit the streets in Sydney's annual City2Surf. Paramedics drive through the crowds to locate a semi-conscious participant suffering from hyperthermia, and a seventy-year-old who collapses after completing the fourteen-kilometre run. Drugs are prominent over the weekend, with a heroin overdose resulting in a cardiac arrest on the street and an ice user crashing his vehicle.
