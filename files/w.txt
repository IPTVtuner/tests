The DIY SOS teams is back and in Birmingham helping a family in need. Charlotte and Chris have twins who were born prematurely and have a condition known as global development delay. Their cramped house is hindering their progress even more and if they have any chance of catching up, they'e going to need DIY SOS and a host of volunteers from the local community to rebuild their lives and give the family a better future.
