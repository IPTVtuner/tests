Three sets of expectant parents are waiting to meet their babies: Kate, who once thought she'd only ever have cats, and her husband Nick; Tendayi and Maxwell, who are in high spirits until they hear screams from a nearby delivery room; and a young couple, Lydia and Phil. Lydia invites her big sister to join her at the birth, and when one of the women begins to feel nauseous, it's not the one you would expect.
