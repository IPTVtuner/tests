Two couples deal with long and difficult labours in very different ways. One dad shows how humour can lift the sprits, while the other prefers to deliver rousing pep talks. Julia (31) and her partner Dean (29) are expecting their first child, while Donna (30) and Wayne (33) are expecting baby number two. Donna is apprehensive: her last labour lasted for days, and she fears she might be in for a repeat experience.
