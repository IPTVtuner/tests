Nigel Slater looks to mother nature for inspiration in this episode of the cookery series, as he explores dishes that work thanks to their marriage of ingredients that have been born and bred together. Whether it is flavours that share the same season or the same landscape, Nigel shows us how we can use the principle of born and bred to transform our everyday suppers.
