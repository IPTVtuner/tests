This time, Stacey and her gang - organizer Dilly, carpenter Rob and cleaner Iwan - help the Lespeare family sort their life out in seven days. An accident has left mum Kirsty with limited mobility, meaning she struggles to keep on top of day to day chores. The family - Kirsty, dad Taurean and their four children - want the team to find storage solutions that won't damage their rented home but will help give Kirsty her independence back.
