Nick Knowles and the team travel to a beautiful village in the Welsh countryside to help a widower and his eight-year-old daughter. Through illness and family loss, David and Erica Williams have been living in a dilapidated caravan for six years. The caravan stands next to the shell of a new build that was once going to be their family home. Erica's mother died two years ago, just as the house was beginning to take shape.
