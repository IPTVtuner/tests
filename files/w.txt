Stacey and her team help the Bradshaw family part with 30 years of clutter in just seven days. It's the biggest challenge the team have faced so far, but it could help the Bradshaws fall back in love with their stunningly beautiful home. Retired electrician Wayne is a car boot sale enthusiast, and daughter Harriet worries that all the clutter is too much for her parents. Craft-loving Sue emotionally reveals that her son Alex is too embarrassed to bring people home.
