Larry Franks withdraws his confession to murdering Cindy Statham and Jo reopens the case believing him to be innocent, but when Neil and Grace interview him again, he clams up when his request to speak to Jo is denied. A videotape recovered from the canal reveals new evidence - but Jo is unaware how close the killer really is. Elsewhere, Mickey investigates a robbery and is stunned when his friend admits to the burglaries.
