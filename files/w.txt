Nick Knowles and the DIY SOS team travel to Duxford near Cambridge. They enlist the aid of local trades to help Paul and Sarah Behan, who had just started an extension to their tiny bungalow when their young son Joshua was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of liver cancer. Joshua's cancer meant the extension had to be abandoned just when it became more necessary than ever.
