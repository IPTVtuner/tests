DS Carter investigates the murder of Liam Powell, whose body is found badly beaten on a footpath. Enquiries reveal that Liam had been drinking at his local on the night of his death, but pub landlord Nick Willis and his girlfriend Louisa Gates insist that he was fine when he left the establishment. They also claim that the pub's CCTV camera is broken so there is no footage of the evening's events. Was there an altercation?
