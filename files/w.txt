The police investigate when the body of a missing boy, 11-year-old Matty Wallace, is found in local woodland. His stressed mother Jane claims she did not realise Matty was missing until she went to his school, while his stepfather tells officers he was working away for several days and knew nothing of Matty's disappearance. The team discover that Matty had planned to run away with a friend, but did not make it.
