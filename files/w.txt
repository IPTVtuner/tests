With the holiday season in full swing, a woman is about to score a big promotion at her ad agency in San Francisco. Her life is unexpectedly turned upside down when she inherits a cosy inn in Alaska from her aunt. When she goes to inspect the property and meets a handsome attorney, she's surprised to find that nothing is what she expected. The small-town community is full of fun and festive Christmas traditions, and she starts wondering if the inn might just be the place she belongs.
