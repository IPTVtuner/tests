Miranda isn't your average girly girl. At 6 ft 1, Miranda gets called Sir once too often, much to the amusement of her childhood friend Stevie who manages Miranda's joke shop. Miranda bumps into her old friend Gary, who is working in the restaurant next door as the new chef. When he asks her out for a drink she gets over excited by the prospect of her first real date and decides it's time to try to be more girly.
