Nick Knowles and the DIY team head to Dumfries in Scotland to meet Sue, whose partner Barry died of a sudden heart attack in 2003, leaving her suffering from depression, dealing with two young children and living in a house that was falling apart. The team enlist the aid of their very own tartan army to tackle this build and try to help get this family back on track.
