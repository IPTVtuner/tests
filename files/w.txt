Derbyshire is the destination for Nick Knowles and the DIY SOS team as they travel to Chesterfield to help Lisa and Richard Watson and their young family. Their daughter Madison was born with a heart defect and a rare eating disorder that requires 24-hour care from Lisa. Richard is a builder who began an extension to their home to accommodate his expanding family.
