Max and Jo raid the house of Jimmy Mack but fail to find his consignment of drugs - or his missing girlfriend, Rochelle. Sally and Roger visit the home of former prostitute and drug addict Fran Morris, where her young son Noah has collapsed. Then Rochelle is found tied to a chair in Fran's flat, having been beaten up.
