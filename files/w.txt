The panel are introduced to four people claiming to be Fern Maxted. They include an LA society girl who bought her Ashford home on the internet and is disappointed the area is less chocolate box, more `glorified car park', a mum of three who has a moral meltdown when someone finds a saucy bottle opener in her drawers, a former PR man who claims that Fern is short for Fernando, and someone who is so adamant that she is the real homeowner that she is prepared to lick the furniture to prove it.
