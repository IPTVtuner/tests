Nick Knowles and the team recruit extra help from the local community to build an extension that will transform a home and bring a family back together. Sue's eldest son Jay suffered a brain injury while playing rugby in the Spring of 2009. Jay has spent over a year in hospital and can only come home when his carers have approved the space he will move into.
