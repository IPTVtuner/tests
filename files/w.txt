Stacey Dooley hosts as panelists Bill Bailey, Emily Atack, Judi Love, Jamali Maddix and guest Katie Piper try to correctly identify the true homeowner. Get it right and the homeowner wins a cash prize, get it wrong and the homeowner gets nothing. This week, four people claim to be Erica, an artist living with partner Sam in a stylish south east London home. They answer questions on everything from Erica's favourite clothes, her relationship with Sam and the story of their wedding day.
