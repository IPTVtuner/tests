The DIY SOS team descend on Caswell Bay, Swansea, where, on behalf of Surfability UK, which receives funding from Children in Need, they transform a dilapidated, disused bus shelter into the world's first purpose-built, fully adaptive surf centre. Children and young people who have benefited from the support of Surfability UK share their stories, showing the immeasurable impact that the group's surf sessions have on those who take part.
