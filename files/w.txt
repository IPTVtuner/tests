Callum and Diane respond to a call from Diane's neighbour, Alun Thomas, and find Steve Myatt unconscious. His wife Angela is missing and Steve admits that they had been arguing and she lashed out - but he doesn't want to press charges. Then, Ali and Emma discover that Angela has been self-harming - as a result of Alun's blackmail. Elsewhere, Smithy and Nate come across two men arguing over a batch of dud raffle tickets.
