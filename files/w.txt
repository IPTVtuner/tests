On patrol, Beth and Nate are approached by Jane Clarke, whose 11-year-old son Dean has gone missing. A note found links the abduction to a case 20 years before when 3 boys were murdered by Alistair Haig and Linda Johnson. Neil and Stuart visit Linda Johnson in prison, and she gives them a name - Mike Wilson. Under questioning, Wilson claims that he has killed Dean - but then a call is received from the terrified boy.
