Nick Knowles and the team recruit help from the local community to renovate a house and change a family's lives. Shaun spent over a year building an extension onto the house where his children lived with their mother. He wanted to give them a home in which they could grow, but sadly he died before he could finish the build. Shaun's best friend wrote in to see whether the team could help finish the extension.
