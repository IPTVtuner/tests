The police are called to the home of Fiona and Howard Walsh by a neighbour. Initially the case seems to be a simple break-in, but when officers discover that the house alarm had been disabled and the safe opened, they begin to suspect otherwise. The couple's son Rory claims not to have seen his parents for weeks, but suspicions are aroused when it comes to light that Howard Walsh had shopped Rory to the police for drug dealing.
