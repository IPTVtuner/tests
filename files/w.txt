With Mother's Sunday approaching, the importance of strong family values is the theme running through this episode. Mel and James want to prove they can be good parents even though they both had a poor start in life. Leah and Richard are Mormons; Richard doesn't say much except to reinforce that he is adamant the baby should be called Richard, as it's his family tradition. Leah isn't so sure.
