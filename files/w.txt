Two strong mothers stand by their daughters giving birth. Sam, who's 23, is covered in tattoos, loves heavy metal and keeps a pet snake. Her partner Biaggio says he's grateful for her mother's never-ending energy when things get tough in the delivery room. Claire, who's 20, and Clint, who's 23, met in a nightclub in Leeds. They split up, but Claire's mother is with her at the birth.
