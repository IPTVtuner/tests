The series returns about life on a maternity ward, this time coming from Leeds. The first episode features two expectant fathers who desperately want to see their babies being born: Shaun is due to start a tour of duty in Afghanistan and has just 48 hours before he has to report for service. Kurt wants to put his `bad lad' ways behind him, but when complications arise he might not be allowed in the theatre.
