Louis Theroux is in Lagos, following the local gangs, the so-called Area Boys, as they patrol their turf, clash with local rivals and keep the peace in a brutal and haphazard fashion. He gets to know the rich and glamorous Area Boy leader MC, a former street youth himself. On the side of the law, Louis rides with KAI, the government's Kick Against Indiscipline paramilitary task force.
