Linda Abbott has been a midwife for 38 years, but her career is coming to an end. Aged 60, she's retiring from her post. Held in high esteem by the other midwives, she reminisces about the old days and remembers delivering several generations of some families. Meanwhile, life goes on in the hospital, with Michelle, resigned to the idea of being a single mother, and Lauren and Kirk who fell in love at first sight.
