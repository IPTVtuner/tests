Inspired by a scribbled note she once found in an old Italian kitchen, Nigella starts with her take on the classic light and sunny yoghurt pot cake. Nigella's niece and nephew are recruited to make a shortcut sausage meatball supper, while a girls' night in sees Nigella rustling up a super quick dish of squid and prawns with marjoram and chilli. The evening ends with Nigella's tiramisini.
