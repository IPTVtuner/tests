When two children go missing, DS Stuart Turner is determined to find them as quickly as possible. His search takes a disturbing turn when CCTV footage shows the children talking to a known paedophile outside a newsagent, who insists he had nothing to do with their disappearance. Elsewhere, new recruit Benjamin Gayle teams up with Will on his first day, and they investigate an attack on a Polish builder.
