PCs Benjamin Gayle and Mel Ryder arrest Paul Rayner for assaulting a man he claims abused him as a boy, but it soon appears to be a case of mistaken identity, and when the team track down the man Rayner meant to target, they cannot charge him on Rayner's allegation alone. Rayner gives the police the name of another victim, but he refuses to testify, leaving Rayner devastated.
