DS Max Carter and DC Jo Masters question Paul Brewer when a raid discloses indecent images of a young girl on his laptop. While at first denying responsibilty, Paul then points the finger of suspicion at paedophile George Fielding, a man he met in prison, and to whom he had recently lent the computer. When DC Jacob Banks questions Fielding, he immediately verifies Paul's story, but Banks is suspicious of both men's statements.
