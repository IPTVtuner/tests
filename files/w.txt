Nick Knowles and the team head to Enfield where they meet Eric Rivers, a keen sportsman who is gradually being deprived of the use of his body by motor neurone disease. Eric is a passionate communicator and a keen advocate for the value of life. Eric, his wife Davina and their three daughters need their terraced house adapted for Eric's needs. They also need additional room.
