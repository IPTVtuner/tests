Nate and Mel are called to Deansgate School to investigate a suspected burglary in teacher Becky James's classroom. One of the suspects is pupil Kim Patterson - who admits that she and Jimmy Ryan broke into the school for a dare but did not do anything wrong. Then, Becky is found at her home, badly beaten and unconscious.
