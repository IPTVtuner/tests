Heaton is hounded by journalists asking questions about the involvement of convicted child killer Linda Johnson in the hunt for Dean Clarke. A ransom note is found and a drop is arranged where Linda is supposed to hand over £10,000, but the sting has to be abandoned when the brother of one of her victims tries to attack her with a knife. After further investigation, Dean's abductor turns out to be Linda's very first victim.
