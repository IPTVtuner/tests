Sophia is having twins, but a scan has shown up a problem with one of them meaning it will have to go to Special Care as soon as it's born. Mum-of-one Hayley is about to give birth for the fourth time, having experienced the trauma of a newborn baby dying and then a stillbirth. Both mums are waiting to deliver their babies, and are hoping for the best.
