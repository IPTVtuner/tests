These parents are big time in 'roommate' syndrome - where they've lost their relationship and it's all about the kids. After struggling for over 8 years to get pregnant, they now have two 'miracles' who, due to Mom's worries, have been sleeping in Mom and Dad's bed since birth and now refuse to leave. It means no sleep for everyone and has led to general crankiness and some serious acting out.
