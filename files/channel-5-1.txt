Sara and Jonathan meet, by chance, while shopping for gloves in New York. At the end of the evening Jonathan is in love, but Sara leaves him by cab, saying that if they are meant to be together, fate will find a way. Years later, as both are ready to marry different partners, destiny does indeed seem to conspire to rekindle their love.
