With the arrival of spring comes the start of lambing season and the whole family work together as lambing begins on the wild moors of their exposed hill farm. 14-year-old Rueben leads his siblings on a rescue mission to find a missing lamb and when dad Clive skins a dead lamb, two-year-old Clemmy is curious to know how an age-old adoption technique will work.
