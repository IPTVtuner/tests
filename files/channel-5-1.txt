Starting and finishing in Havana, Jane takes a trip around Cuba where she falls for the people, the buildings, the music and the 50s cars. She has lunch on the floating Rasta Raft, and enjoys a hot salsa session, before gate-crashing a house party where she discovers no-one parties like Cubans party!
