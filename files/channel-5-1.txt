Shot over three months, this documentary series follows the snowplough drivers and patrols who work around the clock to make sure the UK does not grind to a halt when winter weather hits. In the Highlands, snowplough teams battle blizzards, ice, flooding and landslides to keep the roads open, whilst across the UK patrols fight snow, gales and icy conditions to reach motorists stranded in the cold.
