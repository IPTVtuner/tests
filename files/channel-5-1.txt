When Rachel's pregnancy goes beyond the expected delivery date, the pain makes her increasingly irritable and willing to try anything that might speed up the baby's arrival. Meanwhile, Monica and Phoebe bet on the date of the birth, while Joey can only take one guest to the premiere of his film, and chooses Chandler. Unfortunately, Chandler falls asleep during the screening.
