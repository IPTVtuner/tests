Peppa and family continue driving across America to get to Hollywood. As they drive through the desert, they meet Mr. Buffalo and Mr. Bison who are doing road work just like Mr. Bull from back home. They meet another Miss Rabbit and fly over the Grand Canyon in a helicopter, white water raft through the rapids and discover a cave from 700AD.
