World leaders want Superman to intervene in the arms race, but he is caught in a dilemma - having vowed never to interfere in history. He eventually agrees to destroy all nuclear weapons, but then comes face to face with the android Protean Man, Lex Luthor's latest evil creation. Luthor wants to stoke up the arms race, and sees the android - made from Kryptonite - as the only way to stop Superman.
