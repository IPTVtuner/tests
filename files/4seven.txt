Posh boy and wannabe pop star Charles Maximilian Winnington Leftwich is the third host from Hertfordshire. He hopes his elaborate menu and outdoor music performance will earn him top marks, but it's not an easy ride for the young host who lives at home with his mum. The guests struggle with his starter, the rain threatens to spoil the BBQ, and a row develops about how much money Charles receives from his parents.
