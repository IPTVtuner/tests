It's day four of the competition from Edinburgh, and the host is PA and rock chick, 26-year-old Michelle Lindsay. The week hasn't been great for Michelle so far, as she's been served up all sorts of nasty treats from hair in her dinner, to food that resembles poo! So, Michelle is fairly confident that it won't be too hard to wow her guests with her bizarre array of dishes.
