First to host in Glasgow is make-up artist Craig Alexander Wilson, who is throwing a glitz and glamour party, complete with edible glitter and sparklers. Craig's guests are trainee-dance teacher Mandy Wong, practical joker Paul Cowan, fun-loving Caroline Wardrope, and opinionated music teacher Siobhan Daly. However, Craig's attempt to guess his guests' ages doesn't go down very well.
