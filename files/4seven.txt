Gordon travels to Pasadena, California to visit a Jamaican restaurant called Caf√© Kingston. There, Gordon finds Dr Una Morris, a micro-managing owner who also works as a radiotherapist in a clinic next door to the restaurant. She is determined to use hospital techniques in her kitchen and is constantly sealing everything into plastic bags. Dr Morris is as stubborn as she is proud. Can Gordon help?
