After a fractious first night in Doncaster at Zoe's, it's now chip shop manager Martyn Bilby's turn to host. He's pulling out all the stops with his signature dish `Swan Lake': a chocolate Ã©clair swan on a blue jelly lake. Martyn asks his guests to dress formally, but any chance of impressing them goes out the window when Zoe and Signe spot photos of him posing for a `Mr Doncaster' body building competition.
