On day four in Mansfield, Francophile Rachel Imms hosts a French evening. Will she rise to the challenge that her complicated main course presents? How will the guests react to eating the same dessert two days running? Before dinner is served, Rachel feeds some furry friends. The guests discuss whether French is the language of love, but entertainment in the form of a French accordionist doesn't appeal to everybody.
