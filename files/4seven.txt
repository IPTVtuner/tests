Today, November 17
The fourth host in Leeds this week is theatre technician Matt, who's planning to scoop the prize with a menu of tried and tested family favourites. The food is a winner for student Danielle and she's even more impressed by his juggling skills. But neither hit the mark for IT director Andy, who declares it the worst night of the week so far and things go from bad to worse for Matt when Alice's dessert ends up on the floor.
