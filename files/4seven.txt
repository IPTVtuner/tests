It's the third night in Reading and the turn of mature student Richard Howse. With a menu and set of instructions from his omnipresent girlfriend, Katy, Richard sets about making his pirate themed night the best of the week. A treasure hunt brings out Glen Wilkie's true feelings about fellow guest Serine Daou, and Sonya Smith takes a disliking to some of the gluten-free fare on offer.
