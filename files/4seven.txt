First to host in Lichfield, Staffs is business consultant James Herbert, who has high hopes for his complex Italian menu. He also has some fun photo frolics planned. His guests are 22-year-old football coach Tim Travers, 30-year-old sales assistant and all-round party boy JP Goodyear-Martinez, 38-year-old businesswoman Amanda Smith, and straight-talking retired mental health nurse Ronnie Imlah.
