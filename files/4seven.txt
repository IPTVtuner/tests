The first to host in Edinburgh is 28-year-old Andy Daykin who has opted for a somewhat clich√©d Scottish themed night for his dinner party - complete with haggis, bag pipes, whisky and Cranachan. His guests include self-confessed cougar, Liz Grant, who is planning on pouncing on any available young man during this week's dinner parties.
