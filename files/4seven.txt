In Sheffield, saucy beautician Rochelle Barrett hopes to spice things up with her Caribbean-themed meal. Rochelle's menu provokes mixed reactions from her guests. Robin says it's too down-market for a dinner party. Rochelle's guests are also baffled by her 'upstairs, downstairs' dress code. Later, an 'oven malfunction' brings Rochelle close to breaking point. And as the night unfolds, Robin and Sarah's flirtatious banter turns into trading insults.
