Today, September 14
In Mansfield, a new week kicks off with a jaw-dropping evening of costume, music and homemade recipes from health-conscious granny Tina Ainsworth. She's confident that her Chinese-themed evening will win over her guests, croupier Tomasz Wisniewski, PR consultant Julia Smith, copy writer Rachel Imms, and DJ Gareth Harding. Everything seems to go to plan, and things get flirty at the table.
