It is the final day of the competition in Edinburgh and tonight is the turn of Italian-born food snob, Toni Giugliano to host. Toni thinks that he has been served up poor food all week and tonight is his chance to take the Â£1,000 prize by impressing his guests with his specially created Scottish/Italian menu.
