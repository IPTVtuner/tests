In Doncaster, the first to host is glamorous insurance worker Zoe Prince. She's cooking an Italian-themed menu, despite not being Italian and never having been to Italy. However, that might not be too much of a problem as the other guests don't seem to know their saltimbocca from their vermicelli anyway. With a tip-top menu prepared, Zoe soon learns she's got a lot more on her plate to deal with than just the food.
