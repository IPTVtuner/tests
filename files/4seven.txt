Neat freak Claire Diamond is the second host from Hertfordshire. She hopes to excite her guests with a starter of crispy chilli chicken, a main of roast rack of lamb with potato dauphinoise, and a huge dessert of panacotta, meringue and chocolate cheesecake, while trying to keep her house spotlessly clean. The guests all seem to appreciate her menu apart from Amir.
