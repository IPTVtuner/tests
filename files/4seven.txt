In Southend-on-Sea, the first to host is dog-fancier executive PA Julie-Ann Rayner. Julie-Ann's a dinner party veteran and has high hopes that her `taste of the Sea' menu - with not one, but two fish courses - will have her guests hooked, assuming that they all like fish, that is. If her fishy feast doesn't go down a treat, Julie-Ann has some musical mayhem up her sleeve.
