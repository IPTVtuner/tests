Today, September 14
Third to host in Mansfield is 32-year-old DJ Gareth Harding, who transforms his garden into a Balearic cocktail bar and club complete with lasers and disco lights. His theme is Ibiza, and the guests seem impressed with Gareth's sophisticated menu, but has he bitten off more than he can chew by cooking a tricky beef Wellington? Discussion at dinner turns to Olympic sports.
