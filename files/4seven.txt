The competition comes from Sheffield, and first to host is flamboyant English gent Robin Lockwood, Lord of his three bed semi. Always striving for perfection, Robin has planned his traditional British menu down to the every last detail, from the first lump of caviar to the last mouthful of syllabub. He's even ordered some freshly shot grouse, but not all of Robin's guests are as pleased with his butchered birds.
