It's day one of the competition in east London. Fashionista Simran Samra hosts a glitz and glam night for her guests as she goes head to head with doctor Chintu Gademsetty, comedian Yoshki Greenberg, city boy Alan Price and businesswoman Delia Elliot. Simran cooks meat despite being a vegetarian and buys wine despite the fact she knows nothing about it, and her main course isn't a success.
