It's night two of the competition in Leeds, and company director Andy is hoping to win the grand with a menu of fancy restaurant inspired fare. But Alice and Danielle are more impressed with Andy's Ferrari than his food. And Lynne is more concerned with turning out a perfect Mojito in the cocktail making challenge than anything else. Will Andy's posh nosh be to everyone's taste, and can he hold his composure till the end of the night to bag top spot?
