Latest to host in Bristol is food critic Daryl Bullock. Darryl's other great love is his animals, who make an unexpected appearance during proceedings. It's not long before the evening takes a nose dive when two of the guests stumble across a rather unpleasant surprise left by the cat and are left gagging. Can Darryl's pork belly roast save the day, or will the evening end up a complete dog's dinner?
