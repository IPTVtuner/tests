This week's competition is in Huddersfield, where first host, 49-year-old cheeky mum of three, Virginia Houslin, is hoping to wow her guests with her silver-tongued charm and Caribbean home cooking. The night gets off to a good start when Virginia's hopes for some flirtatious fun get a boost when she opens the door to the first guest.
