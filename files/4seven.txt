The final dinner party from Stoke-on-Trent is hosted by city councillor Matt Wilcox. Matt has travelled the world and eaten in some of the best restaurants, so he feels fully qualified to offer a menu with the wow factor. He wants to inspire thought and wonderment through his food, so his menu starts with a bucket of bones! Next is his spicy twist on a local stew, Caribbean lobby, and topping it all off is Stoke Mess.
