The third day in East Lancashire sees perfectionist Chris Slater try his hardest to add a touch of class. He makes the guests take off their shoes to admire his immaculate interiors. The starter goes down well, but Nigel eating with his mouth open disgusts his fellow diners. The spicy main course leads to acid reflux for Jenna who forgot to bring her tablets, and then Nigel disgraces himself over a shortbread biscuit.
