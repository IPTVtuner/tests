Rick Stein's `journey without maps' takes him through France's eastern border regions of Alsace and Jura home to his favourite French dish, choucroute garni and favourite French cheese, comt√©. He then begins to head inland into Burgundy for a memorable glass of auxey duresses wine and oeuf en meurette with a difference. Following a memorable Sunday lunch near the Swiss border he is inspired to recreate a traditional blueberry tart.
