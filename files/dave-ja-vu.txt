Paul and Bob fly to Enniskillen to fish for Pike. They take to the waters of Lough Erne in their search for this mighty fish, guided by the very experienced local Frenchman Pascal. They discuss their respective bad habits and Bob gives Paul a thorough health update, before they retire to a local hostelry to sample the traditional Irish refreshments.
