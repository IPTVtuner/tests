Dave Ja Vu
Today, March 22
Dave and Si explore the delicious relationship between food and faith and celebrate the vast range of faith-based dishes available in Britain today. They rustle up a delicious Simnel cake and a mouth-watering beef brisket, as well as revealing the history of the hot cross bun and dropping in on an Ethiopian Christmas feast.
