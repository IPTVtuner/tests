Emmerdale stars Danny Miller and Adam Thomas are joined by Love Island's Scott Thomas. The trio of best mates are tortured by a pack of crazed children, take a terrifying ride in a haunted ambulance and face the art gallery from hell aka `The Hate Modern'. Goodbye `Yorkshire Dales' hello `Eastern European wails'.
