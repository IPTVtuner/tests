Today, June 24
James reveals the cars that turned post-war Germany and Japan into motoring powerhouses at the expense of Britain and the US. On his travels he encounters classic E-Types, Mustangs and the German and Japanese upstarts. He also has an unfortunate encounter with an Austin Allegro - the car that helped destroy the British car industry.
