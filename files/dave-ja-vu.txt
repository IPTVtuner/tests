Waking from a coma, a female contract killer wreaks revenge on the assassins who tried to kill her. Known as `The Bride', because she was gunned down on her wedding day, the as yet nameless woman awakens to discover she is no longer pregnant, and goes on a killing spree, taking out one by one the members of her old team of assassins who killed her baby.
