Adventurer Ben Fogle and comedian Hugh Dennis drive a historic route from the Peruvian Andes to the depths of the Amazon, along roads built to conquer and exploit the natural wealth of Peru's rainforest. It's a ride of 2,000 foot drops and hairpin bends on one-lane dirt roads, stretching from mountains high above the clouds to the muddy, humid trails of the jungle. The pair seek the lost city of Constitucion.
