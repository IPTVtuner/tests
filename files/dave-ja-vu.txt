Dave Ja Vu
Today, November 26
Rick continues his odyssey in Thailand where he meets up with one of his heroes, David Thompson, a man who has immersed his professional life into understanding Thai cuisine. He takes a train south to Phuket to learn the art of a hot and sour Tom Yum Goong, the culinary icon of Thailand. Finally he visits Melaka, once the heart of the spice trade, to enjoy the delights of Nyonya cuisine.
