On Christmas Eve Lee and Lucy regret leaving their Christmas shopping to the last minute when Lucy's wallet and mobile phone are stolen from a department store. Lee wants revenge and in pursuit of the thief they are led further and further away from home, into the depths of the countryside from which there is no return.
