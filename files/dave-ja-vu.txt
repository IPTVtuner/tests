Dave Ja Vu
Today, November 21
Dave and Si show that creating a luxury lunch is possible on even the tightest of budgets. They share the very best of their budget-busting gourmet recipes, picking up some set-menu secrets from one of Britain's best Indian chefs and get insider tips on how to get great wine on a shoestring. Everything learnt is put to the test when the boys surprise a very hard-working dinner lady.
