Dave Ja Vu
Today, November 24
Si and Dave celebrate the picnic and make tasty treats that could make your picnic a veritable feast. From their own take on the humble Scotch egg, to a spicy selection of Indian dishes from a Birmingham mum, a Victoria sponge recipe that is nothing short of baking alchemy and bananas wrapped in bacon.
