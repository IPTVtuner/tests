Poor James May. Stuck between his older and younger sisters, Jane and Sarah, his only toys were their hand-me-downs. Sifting through the family toy box prompts James to share his tale of woe. Jane and Sarah do get their say, but not before James blows up the tree house family, races in a converted Silver Cross pram and makes over a Girl's World head.
