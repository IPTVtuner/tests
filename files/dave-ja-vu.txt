Dave Ja Vu
Today, March 25
The Bikers explore the impact our colonial past has had on our food. From the chai in their bread and butter pudding to the India Pale Ale in their sausage casserole, many recipes owe much to the Empire. Dave and Si also explore the history behind gin and tonic as well as Lee and Perrins, both of which arose from our Imperial history.
