Jeremy, Richard and James face their greatest challenge to date as all three are sent to Africa and each told to buy a second-hand car costing no more than £1,500.

Which could be a problem, since their task is then to drive across the wilds of Botswana, negotiating massive salt pans, treacherous rivers and animal reserves.
