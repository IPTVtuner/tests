Gregg Wallace is in Stoke on Trent, at an enormous cherry bakewell factory where they produce 250,000 little tarts every day. He follows the production of cherry bakewells, from the arrival of 27 tonnes of flour right through to dispatch. Along the way he learns what makes a shortcrust pastry `short' and discovers the simple way they ensure every cherry is precisely placed.
