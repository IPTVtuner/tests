Rick arrives in the royal state of Rajasthan, the land of the kings. The majority of Rajasthanis are serious meat eaters with dishes like Junglee Maas, a perfect combination of meat, chillies and spices, easily accessible on game hunts - the favourite pastime of both the Rajputs and Moghuls. This is a land of palaces and hilltop forts, mostly desert and very different from the state of Himachal Pradesh.
