Paul fishes at Christchurch's quintessential Bridge Pool in Dorset, hoping to catch sea trout. Bob arrives late but redeems himself by hooking the first fish of the day. After a glorious morning Paul persuades Bob to charter a boat out to sea in search of sea bass. Bob has a history of seasickness and is not keen but eventually they venture out to the Needles where Paul makes an incredible catch. The fish is too big for Bob to handle so they head off to a local restaurant to prepare it.
