Dave Ja Vu
Today, March 12
Dave and Si remind us that we are not really an island nation, but rather a nation of islands - over 5,000 make up the British Isles and many of these have fascinating culinary histories. The Bikers make a delicious tempura dish from the Queenie Scallops caught off the Isle of Man and a rich cranachan with Islay whisky, before travelling to the Isle of Wight.
