Dave Ja Vu
Today, March 20
Dave and Si enjoy the flavours of home as they explore Britain's love of comfort food. As well as a classic rice pudding, the Bikers prepare their own tastes of home, with Dave's stuffed cabbage leaves and Si's flat rib broth. They also reveal the history of the school dinner and see what comfort food means to all Britons, from the Notting Hill Carnival to Shabbat dinner.
