Comedian Sue Perkins and adventurer Charley Boorman travel across Alaska to the notorious Dalton Highway - a dirt track built in the 1970s as a supply road to support the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. Highway maintenance is a full time job here with avalanche units operating throughout the year. As Arctic conditions close in on them, the pair rely on the help of hardcore truckers for whom the highway is home.
