Dave Ja Vu
Today, July 16
Rob Brydon is back in the host's chair for the award-winning comedy panel show, with Lee Mack and David Mitchell as the lightning-quick team captains. Each week, celebrity guests reveal extraordinary stories about themselves, but are they telling the truth or making it all up? Sorting the fact from the fiction this week are guests Angellica Bell, Bob Mortimer, Suggs and Holly Willoughby.
