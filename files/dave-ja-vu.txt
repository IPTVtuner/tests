Gino D'Acampo is in north western Italy visiting the picturesque region of Liguria. His first stop is the pretty coastal town of Camogli, where he meets a family who make a living from pescaturismo - or fishing tourism. They take him out to sea to experience what life is like for the local fishermen. The calm waters and warm sunshine are a perfect accompaniment as the fresh catch is eaten for lunch on the boat.
