Dave Ja Vu
Today, May 14
Dave Myers and Si King explore our national love of picnics. With their unique banter and camaraderie, the duo create their ultimate al fresco lunch at Beaufort Polo Club; find out how our summer obsession evolved; celebrate picnic classics such as the cornish pasty and the scotch egg; bake a luxurious Dundee cake, and make a country terrine that would play centre stage in any outdoor feast.
