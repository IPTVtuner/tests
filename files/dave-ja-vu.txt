Today, November 23
Si and Dave have toured the nation hunting out Britain's lost family recipes. In this programme, they visit three mums in Scotland and discover what dishes they have been treating their loved ones to over the years. From a classic cheese pie and `rumpy-pumpy soup' to samosas and a world of fantastic cakes, the Hairy Bikers sample them all and then take a trip down memory lane themselves.
