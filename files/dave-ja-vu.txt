Richard and James get together some ageing camper vans and a small troop of touring car drivers for the inaugural Motorhome Grand Prix. Plus, James tests the new Alfa Romeo 159, with a little race around the Humber estuary, and Jeremy gets behind the wheel of the estate versions of the BMW M5 and Mercedes E63 AMG. Lawrence Dallaglio is the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.
