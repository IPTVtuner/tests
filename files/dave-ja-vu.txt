Dave Ja Vu
Today, November 16
Dave and Si show how to create a dinner for two that is fit for a king on a pauper's budget. They cook up delicious gourmet dishes, getting world class presentation tips from two Michelin starred chef Oliver Limousin, and delve back into Britain's rich history for cut price culinary inspiration. They put everything they have learnt to the test when they help single mum Paula say a big surprise thank you.
