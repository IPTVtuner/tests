Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May are challenged to knock down a row of derelict houses in less time than it takes a team of demolition experts to do the same job. Meanwhile, Jeremy tests an updated version of the classic Jensen Interceptor and finds himself transported back to a 1970s world of leather driving gloves and droopy moustaches. Plus, another celebrity tries their hand in the Reasonably Priced Car.
