Dave Ja Vu
Today, May 13
Dave Myers and Si King explore how the British have managed to create fantastic food even at times of war, when supplies are often scarce, and how some of Britain's favourite dishes have evolved out of the innovation and spirit of the people who lived through rationing. The duo try their hand at rabbit stew and carrot cake.
