Dave Ja Vu
Today, March 18
Dave and Si celebrate Britain's taste for the exotic, one of the driving forces of our culinary history. They prepare a classic chilli ginger bread and show how to make the perfect sushi, travel to Tatton Park in Cheshire to see how the Pineapple was once the most expensive and exotic dish available to polite society, and reveal the history behind a piece of exoticism closer to home: the Onion Johnnie Man.
