Gregg Wallace is in South Shields at a clothing factory where they produce 650 waxed jackets a day. He follows the production of water-resistant jackets from the arrival of 500 metre long rolls of undyed cotton through to dispatch. Along the way he sees the fabric dipped into baths of wax heated to 95 degrees Celsius and learns how a 23 piece pattern is used to create a complex 3D jacket jigsaw.
