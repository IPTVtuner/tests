Today, November 17
Indulgent entertaining doesn't have to be costly to be spectacular. Dave and Si share some of their favourite indulgent dishes and get money saving set menu secrets from Michelin starred chef Tom Kitchin. They also delve into our culinary history for some gourmet inspiration. They then put everything learnt to the test when they help an RNLI Helmsman say big surprise thank you to his heroic crew.
