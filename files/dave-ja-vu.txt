Dave Ja Vu
Today, February 27
Dave and Si show how to create a restaurant quality meal on the tightest of budgets. They pick up some insider secrets from two Michelin starred chefs - David Everitt-Matthais and Alexis Soyer. The Bikers put everything they've learnt into practice when they help three young girls say a big thank you to two very important people.
