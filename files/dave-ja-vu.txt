The sixth show of the series is a family affair as two brothers and a sister face the freaky forest challenge. The trio enter a forest at dusk in a quest to unlock chests full of prize money, but in order to win the jackpot they must get back out again. Can they manage to bag the cash, outrun a pack of angry dogs and make it to the finish line in one piece?
