Gino goes from arrivederci to Sardinia and moves on to Palermo, the capital city of Sicily. Famous for being the home of the mafia, along with a vibrant street food culture and interesting history, this coastal city stops Gino in his tracks. He has an unexpected encounter at the street food market, meets a man who stood up to the mafia, and then visits the city of Marsala for a spot of wine tasting.
