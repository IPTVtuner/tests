Dave Ja Vu
Today, March 08
Dave and Si make the most of Britain's outstanding shellfish, cooking up a hearty beef and oyster pie and an exquisite crab and scallop mornay. They help throw a crayfish party on the banks of the Thames and also explore the history of a British classic now almost forgotten: the winkle.
