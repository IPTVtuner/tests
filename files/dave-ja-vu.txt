Gino is on the road again, leaving the mountains and heading south to the coast. On his way, he takes a fishing trip and learns how fishing in the deep blue waters runs a close run second to farming on this island. He then visits the bustling capital city of Cagliari, where he is introduced to the unique textures that the locals use to enhance their fish dishes.
