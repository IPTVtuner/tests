Robson heads to the east coast of Kenya, where the Indian Ocean offers some of the best game fishing in the world. After going head-to-head with the elusive dorado and the fearsome wahoo, he joins some locals for a spot of traditional dhow fishing. The trip ends with a battle with a huge black marlin.
