Dave Ja Vu
Today, March 19
Dave and Si explore the history behind our greatest staple food - the potato. From a warming Lancashire potato and butter pie to a chicken casserole with potato cobbler, recipes that show the unassuming tuber at its best. They also look at how British potato vodka is winning global awards and remember a dark time in Welsh history when the fish and chip shops almost ran out of chips.
