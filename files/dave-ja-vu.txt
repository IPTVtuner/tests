Today, September 07
James goes off-road to tell the story of how the 4x4 conquered the world. From the wartime jeep and the global struggle between Land Rover and Land Cruiser, to the white-knuckle world of rallying and boy racers. James conquers Mount Fuji and races through the sun scorched Mojave Desert to decide which is the ultimate people's 4x4.
