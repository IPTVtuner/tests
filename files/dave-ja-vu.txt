James May commemorates the 40th anniversary of the Apollo Moon landings. He meets three of the men who walked on the moon, before experiencing the thrill of weightlessness, and the bone-crushing G forces of a Saturn V rocket launch. Finally, he puts on his own space suit and flies to the edge of space in a U2 spy plane, where he looks down at the curvature of the earth, and upwards into the black infinity of space.
