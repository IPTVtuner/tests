The BMW 1 Series elbows its way into the world of the small hatchback, Jeremy and James take a look at the range of cars flooding the market from South East Asia, and the Ariel Atom takes to the track. Later, Richard splashes about in a supercharged German army half track, and Trinny and Susannah are this week's Stars in a Reasonably Priced Car.
