Dave Ja Vu
Today, March 07
Dave and Si brave the high seas to celebrate Britain's incredible fishing industry. From sardines on toast to a spicy fish curry, they show us how versatile a British fish dish can be. They also revisit the history of traditional Welsh coracle fishing before travelling to the Isle of Wight to see how other species can replace our over-fished favourites.
