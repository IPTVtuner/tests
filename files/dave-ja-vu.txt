Dave Ja Vu
Today, March 15
Dave and Si explore British woodlands, revealing the hidden gems that can be found within them. They prepare a wild boar ragu from the beasts which once roamed free and a creamy bramble fool plucked from the hedgerow. They also explore the long history of poaching in the UK and show how, with a bit of know-how, the woodland can become a medicine cabinet as well as a larder.
