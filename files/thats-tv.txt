Today, November 27
Natalie and her boyfriend Dave live with her dogs Buster and Morgan. Morgan is as good as gold, but Buster isn't: for the last seven years he's been wrecking Natalie's home. He may look like butter wouldn't melt in his jaws, but behind that cute face lurk some very nasty habits. Number one is regularly cocking his leg all over the house, including the kitchen and even on housemate Morgan.
