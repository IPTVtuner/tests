That's TV
Today, April 16
It's Friday and Frank is nowhere to be seen, which is a bit odd as it's Giro day; he never goes missing on Giro day. The family start a manhunt and panic sets in when a body is found in the canal. Frank eventually turns up in Calais with no passport and no clue as to how he got there, but Fiona gets suspicious when she notices that her new man is smoking fancy French cigarettes.
