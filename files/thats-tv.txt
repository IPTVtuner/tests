That's TV
Today, January 17
The programme examines why leaders, often political rather than military, decide on the use of a pre-emptive strike, with two notorious examples. The first is December 6th, 1941, the `day of infamy', when a Japanese surprise attack on the US fleet base at Pearl Harbour brought the United States into World War II. The second is the Israeli attack which began the Six-Day War of June 1967.
