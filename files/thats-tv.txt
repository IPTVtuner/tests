Telling the story of Harry Selfridge who arrived in London from Chicago in 1908 with a grand plan to open the finest department store in the world in just one year. The road to the grand opening is not always smooth though as Harry's business partner pulls out at the last minute, and he gets a frosty reception from the British press. With an ever-growing pay-roll, and his family about to arrive from the States, the pressure is on to get the store up and running.
