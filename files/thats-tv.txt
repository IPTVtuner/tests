Today, November 14
When Paddy's caught on camera for an armed robbery and could face 20 years inside, Mimi begs him to call his brother Noel. He's the only one who can help, but Paddy has a dark history with his sibling and would rather go to jail than ever set eyes on him again - until the reality of his situation dawns, and he realises he has no choice.
