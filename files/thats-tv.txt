Today, April 19
Ian returns from his travels unaware that the car he's driving back to England as a favour for a friend harbours a secret cargo. Meanwhile, it's Paddy and Mimi's anniversary but, with a party planned at the Jockey and still no sign of Paddy, Mimi becomes increasingly worried about his fate. Elsewhere, Debbie and Maxine's shoplifting trip goes horribly wrong when they find themselves locked inside a shopping centre overnight.
