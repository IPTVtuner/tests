From Germany's dramatic invasion of Poland, France, and Russia, to the Battle of Britain, the key battles in Africa, and onto the attack of Pearl Harbour and the eventual defeat of the Nazi army in Stalingrad. This programme focuses on all the major events of this period, and also pays particular attention to the war's final year and the gradual destruction of the German army.
