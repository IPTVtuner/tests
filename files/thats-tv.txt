Tom and Susanna arrive at Damson Dene a couple of weeks before their wedding to make sure everything is in place. Susanna is five-and-a-half-months pregnant and Tom's grandmother has been very ill so there is no time to lose. Even though he lives alone in a caravan with his dog, Fly, Hotel Manager Wayne is a bit of a romantic. So he loves to put on the perfect wedding in one of the three civil ceremony rooms.
