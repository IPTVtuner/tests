In the first episode, Trevor tracks down one of Vegas's most infamous residents - former heavyweight champion of the world Mike Tyson. Bail bondsmen and bounty hunters have been operating in Nevada for over 150 years, long before Vegas was founded. To get a perspective on this hangover from the Wild West, Trevor meets veteran bail agent and gun collector Jon Foster.
