When DC Chris Skelton opens CID's post and discovers a human hand, DCI Gene Hunt and his team find they have a murder to solve. The only defining feature on the severed limb is a strange burn mark and DI Alex Drake and the team discover there have been a string of single women murdered across the country, each left with the same crescent moon shaped burn.
