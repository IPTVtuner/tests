Mickey pines for somebody to love so when the opportunity arises for him to adopt a cat it becomes the perfect outlet for his paternal urges. When the cat is diagnosed with AIDS he turns to HIV positive Lulu rather than his bigoted family, for help. Meanwhile Chesney is away and Bradford is in charge of the shop, much to Sita's irritation. The pair argue, but finally reach a new level of understanding and respect.
