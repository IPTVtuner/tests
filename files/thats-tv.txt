Today, May 16
Carl wants his family back together, and that means getting rid of Norma for good, but things don't go to plan when Norma proves to be a very tough adversary. Elsewhere, Frank agrees to work on Shane's ice cream van, which the Maguires use as a cover for drug dealing, but there's trouble brewing as Shane has annoyed several people on the estate, something he's `forgotten' to mention to Frank.
