When Ian gets caught up with someone on the run he's initially reluctant to help them, but the more time they spend together, the more their attraction to each other grows; everything seems to click between them, only problem is, she's a girl. Elsewhere, Karen is determined to out-do Jamie on the fun run but it's not just friendly competition as they're obviously both attracted to one another.
