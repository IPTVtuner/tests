The programme looks at the history and principles of guerilla warfare. Examples include Afghanistan 1979-88, where guerilla warfare won the military campaign and then went on to political victory. Vietnam 1961-73 is another classic study as Vietcong guerillas were steadily ground down by superior American firepower and mobility.
