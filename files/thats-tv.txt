Frank and Sheila's wedding day looms and, in preparation, Sheila commissions a conservatory for her backyard. Unfortunately, she doesn't bargain on the builders having to excavate for the foundations. In a sudden wild panic she cancels the work, and then confesses to Frank the reason why: her first husband, Sheldon, is buried under the patio. Meanwhile, Veronica's last stab at IVF on the NHS has failed again.
