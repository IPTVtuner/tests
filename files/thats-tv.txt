Today, March 27
The sun is shining in Benidorm again and although Pauline is more or less permanently drunk, everyone is looking forward to Eighties Night with special guests Bananarama. Madge learns that there is the chance of a lease on a bar coming up - but will she be brave enough to stay on in Spain without Mel? Elsewhere, Kenneth takes Gavin on a trip to cheer him up, but the day does not prove to be as relaxing as promised.
