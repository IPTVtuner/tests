That's TV
Today, November 24
Friday night at the Jockey and barman Kev is dealing with the usual drunken women on the prowl. When one gets too pushy, he tells her that he's already getting married - without telling his girlfriend Veronica first. Elsewhere, Mandy Maguire doesn't take Ian's rejection of her sexual advances very well and her brothers, the hardest on the Chatsworth estate, are on the warpath.
