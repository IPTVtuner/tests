That's TV
Today, September 19
Belle's life is getting more complicated as she tries to juggle three different identities - an escort, an author, and Hannah, the real girl. A disguised Belle attends the launch of her book, but her confidence is knocked by hearing criticism first-hand. Her handsome editor Duncan reassures her that she has what it takes to be a writer, but Bambi and Ben have issues of their own with the book.
