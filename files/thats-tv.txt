Today, January 26
Sammy cannot come down after his comeback performance, so he calls Monty in the small hours to tell him that he is ready for a night at Neptune's and is over 'the fear'. Monty is not convinced and tells Sam that it is time to cut their losses, but an impromptu afternoon performance and a chance meeting with a super fan persuades him to change his mind, so it is full steam ahead for a scintillating Solana evening.
