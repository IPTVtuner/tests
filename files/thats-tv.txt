Today, April 25
Sir Henry arrives at the Solana to ask Joyce for a favour - the Benidorm Palace has had a power cut and he needs an alternative venue to host the Pride of Benidorm Awards that very night. Joyce is not keen, but an intervention by Crystal Hennessy-Vass soon silences her objections. Sammy Valentino is the sleazy Z-list celebrity chosen to host the awards and he soon starts causing trouble with his cheesy patter and wandering eye.
