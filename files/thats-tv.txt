It's the school holidays and the Damson Dene hotel is full to bursting with families and their young children. From reception to the gardens, from the bedrooms to the hallways and even under tables in the dining room, kids are everywhere, pushing the staff to the limits. Even manager Wayne, who normally loves the family atmosphere at the hotel, admits that if he were going on holiday he'd chose a child-free hotel.
