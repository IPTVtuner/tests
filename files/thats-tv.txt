That's TV
Today, April 18
Paddy wakes up disorientated, chained to a bed in a strange room, and unable to remember where he is or how he got there. When Maureen comes in things seem a little clearer: they've been secretly seeing each other since they met in the graveyard. However, when Maureen refuses to release Paddy or tell him what she plans to do with him, he's even more worried. Is it all a sex game or something much more sinister?
