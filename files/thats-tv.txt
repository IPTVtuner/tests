It was Hitler's deadliest secret. His scientists had promised him an atomic bomb. If he got it first, Nazi domination was assured. In 1943, a team of Norwegian raiders was sent to destroy a depot in the heart of Norway where heavy water, the one thing needed to complete the bomb, was produced. This documentary explores the raid, with veterans' accounts, archive film, reconstructions, and 3-D graphics.
