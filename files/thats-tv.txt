The Grosvenor in Torquay is a traditional three-star British holiday hotel, with a difference. Manager Mark Jenkins lives alone in one of his own guest bedrooms and has a track-record of turning failing seaside hotels around. In this episode, guests Faye and Mike are to marry at the hotel, formerly Torquay's premier wedding venue. However, recent weddings haven't all gone to plan, and all is far from calm for this one.
