Today, January 31
A tenth series begins, and the unthinkable has happened: the Department of Work and Pensions has finally caught up with job dodger Frank. A nightmare fantasy emerges of Frank on death row with the Chatsworth characters appearing as cell mates. Meanwhile, Shane and Jackson launch a new enterprise of bootleg booze, and Avril supplies pills to Patty, who wants more than her recommended dosage.
