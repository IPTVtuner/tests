That's TV
Today, June 13
Revealing life in The Damson Dene, a typical three-star British holiday hotel nestling in the five-star setting of the Lake District. In the first episode Dan and Liz, a happy young couple from Essex, check in for a quiet break. What Liz doesn't know is that Dan has brought her here to ask for her hand in marriage. He thinks he's found the perfect spot to pop the question - the bridge over the duck pond.
