When a small child goes missing from a children's party, Frank turns the crowd into a lynch mob lashing out at anyone who looks a bit different, ice-cream man included. When Fiona and Steve find that the child is with nine-year-old Debbie, the Gallaghers have a problem: how are they going to get the child back without questions being asked and Debbie ending up in serious trouble?
