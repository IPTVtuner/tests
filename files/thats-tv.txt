Frank stuns the family by turning up in the morning to get his post even though it's not even Giro day. When a mountain of unpaid bills and some very scary-looking bailiffs turn up at the house, the family discover that Frank is hatching a plan to get his hands on maintenance from his ex-wife Monica, even though he's not living with his kids either.
