Marty befriends a Brazilian housemaid and determines to rescue her from her life of servitude. Kelly insists it's none of their business, but that doesn't deter Marty, who liberates her with a stack of cash he was supposed to be banking for Lillian, causing all sorts of undignified consequences. Dom springs an uninvited guest on Gloria: their birth mother Hazel, but there's no love lost between the two.
