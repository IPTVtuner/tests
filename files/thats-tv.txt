Karen Fletcher loves felines, but after 22 years as a cat owner, she decided to get a dog. So she bought Niles the Chihuahua because he was roughly the same size as a cat - treated him like a cat - and has never known a moment's peace since. Niles growls and bites, pees in the house, and won't let Karen anywhere near him. Taking him out for a walk requires military planning to minimise the bloodshed from his bites.
