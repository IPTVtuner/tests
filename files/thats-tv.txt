Checking in to the Damson Dene are Richard and Rebecca from Manchester, who have two young babies and haven't spent a night on their own for 14 months. Richard's just turned 30, and when Rebecca asked him what he wanted for his birthday, he said "a night's sleep". Also visiting the Damson Dene are Simon, an engineer for the Royal Navy, and his Brazilian girlfriend Vanusa, whom he met while on a naval posting oversea.
