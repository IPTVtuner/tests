That's TV
Today, October 11
Mick is unimpressed when his nice-but-dim brother Pete and his crotchety dad Stan arrive in Benidorm for Pete's stag party. Meanwhile, Gavin thinks that Troy has dumped him so he agrees to a date with Emilio, and Trudy comes up with a way to get intimate with Mateo, but her plans are scuppered by Les/Lesley. Elsewhere, Donald takes Michael and Liam to see Jacqueline perform her erotic striptease at a local club.
