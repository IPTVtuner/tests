That's TV
Today, February 15
In the penultimate episode of the series, there is a gunman on the loose and his target is Frank, whose frolicking with the Gastric Bandits has landed him in deep trouble with Derilee's vengeful husband, Biddy. While the police hunt switches to the Gallagher household, it's business as usual at the Jockey, except Lillian has a new man in tow - Cajun Dave - who brings some light relief with his music.
