Marty needs a job fast and turns to crime to tide him over, but he's not a smooth criminal, and using items borrowed from the Maguires wasn't the smartest plan. Kelly learns that there's a price on Marty's head, but surely Shane won't grass. Elsewhere, Billy is standing up for his rights as a father, he wants to give Cilla her second name. Mimi is reluctant, but offers him an ultimatum: to join her side.
