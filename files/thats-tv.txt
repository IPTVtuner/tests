That's TV
Today, December 19
The British Olympic Synchronised Swimming team are in town to practise and Joyce persuades them to stay at the Solana. Although the team's very strict coach is not too impressed with the facilities, she agrees to Joyce's plan for a gala display in the hotel's pool. Elsewhere, Madge is very keen on the handsome Mohammed, the son of a wealthy property developer who knew Mel, and the girls of the swimming team go sightseeing.
