Alex thinks she's close to death and has to keep her brain alive by solving the case: a raid at a post office. Gene believes the culprit is Chas Cale, a blagger he crossed swords with years ago. When Chas claims he's too old, Gene reflects on whether he too is over the hill. For once, Alex needs Gene to be strong for her. She fears she can't solve the case alone and is desperate not to die in 1981.
