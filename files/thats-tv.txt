Joanna Lumley goes on the trip of a lifetime - exploring the River Nile, from sea to source. Joanna follows the Nile through Egypt capturing the spirit of Agatha Christie in Cairo and later on a Nile cruise. She travels by train, road and Felucca barge, discovering life as it is today along one of the world's greatest rivers, ending in Aswan, a town the Victorians viewed as `being on the edge of civilisation'.
