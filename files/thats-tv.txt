That's TV
Today, September 16
Transfer day and a baggage handlers' strike at the airport cause panic at the Solana. The Dawsons hightail it to the airport with their anniversary party in jeopardy, but it looks increasing likely that they won't be getting back to the UK to celebrate. They get the cold shoulder at check-in from some very unhelpful staff, but every cloud has a silver lining when Billy meets his lifetime hero Holly Johnson and a reincarnated Ron Pickford gives Eddie a shock.
