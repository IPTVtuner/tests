Today, May 28
Aidan's bad behaviour has landed him in court, but it's Patty who'll decide the outcome. Threats are made, but money is tight and Frank knows Aidan's worth too much to lose, problem is, Aidan knows it too. Revenge is a dish best served cold, and Aidan fears that he has delivered a near-fatal portion before returning to his real home. Will he be welcomed with open arms?
