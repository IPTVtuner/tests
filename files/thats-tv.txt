Today, April 03
Aidan is under great pressure when OAP Stanton suddenly dies while Aidan is caring for him as part of his community service. Dom suspects he could be guilty of murder, but is Aidan an innocent man? Elsewhere, Esther is struggling to raise the kids without Kassi, but a chance encounter with Frank persuades her that life's not that bad as a single parent. Thalia is far from pleased about this.
