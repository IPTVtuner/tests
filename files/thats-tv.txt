Jed is a three-year-old, 50lb American bulldog whose aggressive behaviour is ruining his owners' lives. Niel is in the navy and is away 40 weeks a year, so he got Jed as a companion for Kelly, but now Jed's taken over the house and is so jealous of Kelly that he won't allow Niel and her to get close when he's back home. Even worse, jealous Jed attacks everyone who comes into the house. Can Victoria help?
