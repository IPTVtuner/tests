That's TV
Today, April 28
New manager Joyce organises a dance competition for the guests and everyone is eager to take part. Rehearsals are supervised by her old flame Cyril Babcock, an ageing playboy whose impatience with the talentless contestants leads to a dance-off with Mateo. Elsewhere, Kenneth hires an assistant for the salon, but her minimal knowledge of hairdressing and English leads to an unfortunate accident with her first client.
