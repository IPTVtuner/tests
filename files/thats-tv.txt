That's TV
Today, January 11
It's a black day on Chatsworth when Paddy Maguire is returned in a coffin. While the residents grieve, Jamie gathers the Maguires to lift the lid on this `special delivery'. Leticia dares Aidan to break in and take a photo of Paddy in return for a kiss, but they're in for quite a surprise. Elsewhere, Karen sets up a kids' entertainment business, but the joke's on her when Mickey, Avril and Lillian join the team.
