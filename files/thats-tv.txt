The new minister at Rab's church arrives with two serious drawbacks for a Govan minister - she is female and English. Worse still, she arrives just as Rab's Christianity has been severely tested. He has been led into temptation by a bottle of tonic wine. At the first service they do not make a good impression on one another with the Minister trying to stand up for Christian values and Rab simply trying to stand up.
