Today, May 25
Jamie's ex-cellmate Mark comes to stay but Karen doesn't trust him and the battle lines are drawn: Karen's got a fight on her hands if she's to prevent Mark from leading Jamie back into a life of crime. Elsewhere, when Carl gets poor grades in his GCSEs he realises everybody thinks he's a failure, so he sets out to prove them wrong and, with a little bit of help from Paddy, finds his real talent: in the boxing ring.
