The dysfunctional Gallagher clan returns with more outrageous misadventures. It's Lip's 18th birthday and he's in for a few surprises, not least what the Maguires expect of him now he's come of age. Adding to the tension, the kids' long-lost mother Monica turns up at Lip's party, and threatens to turn their world upside down. Elsewhere, Debbie really wants her mum out of the house, but how far will she go to achieve it?
