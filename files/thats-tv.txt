Joyce becomes convinced that new guest Mrs Simmonds is the hotel assessor, but her attempts to impress do not start smoothly when Mrs Simmonds witnesses Joyce evicting a furious Kenneth from his salon for late payment of rent. The hotel is also playing host to underworld figures Lennie and Neville, who gave Donald a hard time when he was in prison.
