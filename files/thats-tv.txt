From bingo to barbecues, nobody does a holiday quite like Mark Jenkins, and even when he does venture abroad he has to take his Union Flag with him and plant it on the beach. In Torquay it's nearing the end of the summer season and to make the most of the clear blue skies Mark decides to throw one more barbecue pool party. Checking into the hotel are Rose and Alan from Wales, who spent their honeymoon in Torquay 35 years ago.
