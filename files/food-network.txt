Mary is out for a day, and a night, on the town. London's busy West End attracts millions of visitors every year, and Mary is joining them as she seeks out the secrets of getting busy people fed quickly and well. She will discover the art of high speed wok cooking in Chinatown, sample the delicious sweet treats being made daily from London's first ever patisserie before catching a show and a late night cocktail with some of its cast.
