Ainsley proves that granny knows best, drawing from his memories he starts by recreating a comforting gold top Irish stew made by his friend's granny. He's joined by pal Brian Turner, who makes him classic sage and chicken cobbler from a family recipe. EastEnder and I'm A Celebrity... star Jessica Plummer drops by, while Ainsley knocks up the Lancastrian favourite, buttery Eccles cakes.
