James is joined by Galton Blackiston, his pal and a top-class, Michelin-starred chef. They don diving suits to swim with seals, and hire an unusual mode of transport to take them around the islands. Galton visits a sea salt farm and delivers some back to James, who uses it to cook up some wonderful salt-baked sea bass. James finds an unusual restaurant situated in the middle of a post office, and finishes off the day cooking roast duck by a stunning seashore.
