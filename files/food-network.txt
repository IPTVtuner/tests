Mary heads to the dramatic Yorkshire coastline to celebrate a unique bonfire party, explore the ancient seaport of Whitby and sample some classic, coastal comfort food, fish and chips and ice cream. Mary visits a small smokehouse that has been run by the same family for five generations, where she helps to smoke herring to make their world-renowned kippers.
