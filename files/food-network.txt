Jamie Oliver travels Britain to find out what makes our food great. He's searching for new ideas and inspiration to create his own versions of British classics. He kicks off his road-trip close to home in the East End, uncovering his family's roots in the area and tasting classic pie and mash and modern Vietnamese street food, as well as meeting a chef turning humble burgers into gourmet cuisine.
