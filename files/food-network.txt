Ina makes dinner to celebrate the arrival of her friend's newborn son. There's a delicious nursery food menu and an incredible setting to match. There's Truffle Popcorn with drinks followed by Spicy Turkey Meatballs, Strawberry Rhubarb Crisp and S'mores around the fire pit. The whole meal is served outside under incredible garden lights designed by Ina's friend Greg Yale.
