Chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall is a renowned carnivore who loves animals, both alive and on his plate. With meat and fish being staples of British menus, the demand leads to problems for human health, the health of animals and the quality of the meat and fish people eat. In order to ease the situation, Fearnley-Whittingstall tries to get people in Britain to eat more veg. As a result, Fearnley-Whittingstall challenges himself to become a vegetarian for a summer to see what simple pleasures are being overlooked in a world filled with meat eaters. As he travels throughout the U.K. searching for vegetarians, Fearnley-Whittingstall learns about a new world of flavours from around the world that have one thing in common -- a lack of meat -- as he prepares to eat what is apparently uneatable.
