Yotam's journey begins with a trip to an unusual open-air restaurant - set in an idyllic cove and managed by a hermit. He grills red mullet, accompanied by a lemon and celery salad. Yotam also finds a Jewish restaurant that serves their twist on Tunisian dishes and where he prepares succulent chicken and sweetcorn meatballs, served with a tangy lemon salsa.
