This trip, Guy's pulling up to some longtime favourites. In Williston Park, New York, the 1920's candy and ice cream place that's added mozzarella sticks and rigatoni to an old school fountain menu. In Sonoma, California, a spot in a historic downtown building doing a lamb burger with an African twist and scratch made borscht.
