Jamie Oliver aims to inspire people to eat better and spend less on their weekly food bills. In this first episode - in which all recipes cost under £1.80 per portion - Jamie cooks up a glorious `mothership' roast brisket of beef with all the trimmings. He then turns his leftover beef into an incredible Korean stir-fried rice.
