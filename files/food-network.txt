Si King and Dave Myers are throwing a Christmas party for family, friends and some of the people they have met on the road over the last few years. However, this is a `hairy' party so it will be anything but predictable. It's all about finger food, those tiny mouthfuls of loveliness that brighten up the festive season from the first Christmas party right through to New Year's Eve.
