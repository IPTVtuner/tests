Nigel Slater looks at how spicy flavours work so well with something cooling. From a classic chicken curry to a spicy tomato stew with yoghurt, Nigel shares some of his favourite dishes, and to prove just how versatile this food pairing is, he cooks up a new version of a traditional pudding. Nigel also travels to Bristol to meet a man who is passionate about pepper.
