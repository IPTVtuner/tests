James Martin invites the Hairy Bikers to stay in his trailer before descending on the market at Concarnau, which is well stocked with fresh seafood, meat and vegetables. With bags full of langoustines, fresh local apples and pork they head back to their campsite to prepare the ultimate prawn cocktail and a mouthwatering pork and apple dish, cooked with local cider.
