Ainsley is using nuts and seeds to create all his tasty dishes. His first recipe, roasted beetroot, candied walnut and goat's cheese salad is full of earthy flavours using nuts to add a satisfying crunch. Ainsley visits the Funky Nut Co for a tour with founder Julian, who makes peanut butter with a difference. Back in his own kitchen, Ainsley uses a very special peanut butter in his hearty sweet potato, spinach and peanut stew, a comforting vegan dish.
