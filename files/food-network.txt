Join Ainsley in his kitchen where he is cooking up some relaxing and comforting food for lazy Sundays, including sweetcorn fritters with avocado, tomato and black bean salsa, and poached egg. Gyles Brandreth joins Ainsley to demonstrate his take on the fish finger sandwich. Plus, BOSH! chefs Henry Firth and Ian Theasby show Ainsley how to concoct their custard tarts for that Sunday sweet fix, before Ainsley finishes the menu with a rosemary and anchovy slow roasted lamb with roasted roots.
