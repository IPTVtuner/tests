In the third series, the search for Britain's best amateur baker is back as 12 passionate baking fans compete for the title. Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins return as presenters, as do judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, who devise the three challenges faced by the competitors each week. They incorporate a signature bake, which tests the bakers' personality and creative flair; a technical bake, which tests experience; and a showstopper bake, during which the bakers are able to showcase their depth of skill and talent. Berry and Hollywood inspect, prod and sample the baked goodies as they decide who gets to have their cake - and eat it.
