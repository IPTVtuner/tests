Jamie's road trip takes him to Leicester where he discovers the impact the British Empire and our love for spice have had on Britain's food culture. He meets Gujurati chef Amita Mashru, who has transformed a pub into one of the city's most popular curry houses. He also buys some fresh Indian veg from the market and meets some asparagus growers.
