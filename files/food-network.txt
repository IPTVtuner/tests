James and his wingman, top chef Mark Jordan, hop aboard their motorbikes to discover the wonderful island of Guernsey. They sample local speciality Gache cake, a seafood platter fit for a king, and James uses Guernsey's wonderful dairy produce to make a delicious creamy rice pudding with chargrilled peaches. Finally, James and Mark set themselves a fishing challenge by attempting to catch the King of the Sea: the mighty turbot.
