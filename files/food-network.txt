Ina Garten is sharing all her secrets and pro tips for Italian dishes. She starts with a fabulous two-fer, tomato eggplant soup, and the leftovers become baked pasta with tomatoes and eggplant. Then she makes flounder Milanese topped with arugula salad and lemon vinaigrette for a modern twist on a classic. Italian ingredients shine in her kale salad with pancetta and pecorino, and finally, Ina makes a cocktail to toast all things Italian, the limoncello vodka Collins.
