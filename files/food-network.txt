Jamie travels to Yorkshire, uncovering how the Industrial Revolution, and the need for immigrant workers, changed everything from the people on our streets to the food on our plates. Jamie starts at the Kings Arms pub in the village of Heath where huge Yorkshire puddings are washed down with pints of ale. In Leeds, home to the third-largest Jewish community in Britain, Jamie samples chicken soup and smoked fish.
