Food Network
Today, December 28
One of the most popular television programmes in the United Kingdom returns for an eighth season as twelve new budding bakers compete to be crowned the champion. Established judge Paul Hollywood is joined by food connoisseur Prue Leith, while seasoned entertainers Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding take on the role of being the show's new hosts. Despite the change in personnel, the key Bake Off traditions remain intact, as the contestants try to impress the panel with a fine selection of beautifully-crafted and delicious cakes, tarts, breads and more.
