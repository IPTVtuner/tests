Jamie prepares some exciting alternatives to traditional Christmas desserts. Mum Sally joins Jamie in the kitchen to make a killer chocolate mousse: and she reminds him how excited he was as a kid at Christmas, especially when he got a drum kit! Jamie's Winter Pudding Bombe is a Christmas take on summer pudding, with panatone, ice cream, crystalised fruit and sherry. Just bang it in the freezer and hey presto.
