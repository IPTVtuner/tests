Building on the success of `Jamie's 30 Minute Meals', this new series of 40 programmes squeezes the cooking process even further, with each half hour episode featuring two delicious, nutritious, super-fast family meals back-to-back. Jamie cooks chilli con carne meatballs, plus sticky kicking chicken, watermelon radish salad and crunchy noodles.
