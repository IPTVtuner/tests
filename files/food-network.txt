Marcus develops plans to create a orchard and bring in the perfect eating apple for his favourite dessert, the classic tarte Tatin. A trip to Kent introduces him to the wide range of heritage apples available in the UK, as well as giving him some tips and tricks on how to grow his own. Back at the farm, he gets a lesson on attracting pollinators, and discovers there is a whole world of edible flowers. He also cooks up some incredible Indian-style chutneys with a glut from the kitchen garden.
