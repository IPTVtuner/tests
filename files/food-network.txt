Jamie's visits the West Country, famous for pasties, cheddar and cider. However, Jamie's in search of less traditional fare, and has some Jamaican cooking in Bristol and Guyanese specialities with Jules Davis. Jamie forages for wild mushrooms with local chef Toby Gritten, cooks up a recipe of bath chaps (pigs' cheeks), and tries some local scrumpy with the Wilkins family at their apple farm in Somerset.
