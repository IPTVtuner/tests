James returns home to his native Yorkshire, where he is joined by good friend and multi award-winning chef Brian Turner. James visits top chef Frances Atkins' beautiful restaurant the Yorke Arms, where he enjoys her signature dish al fresco, in her unusual dining room the Onion. Brian tastes the delights of some Yorkshire charcuterie, and later they both take time out, where James brushes up his clay pigeon skills and Brian is challenged to some off-road driving.
