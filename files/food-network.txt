Jamie is joined by daughters Poppy and Daisy to make some American-style pancakes that work every time; and they're a great way to get your kids involved in cooking. Next, he prepares a delicious roasted squash and seared beef carpaccio salad: something that could work as a starter or a snack. Then, he gets his 89-year-old nan Betty into the kitchen to prepare some gammon with poached eggs.
