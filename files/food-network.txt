Si King and Dave Myers are on the search for the most interesting food that Britain's mums are cooking for their families this Christmas. Si and Dave tour the nation hunting out Britain's festive favourites and a few surprises. On their journey they find mums cooking everything from roast goose with all the trimmings to Pinnekjott and from festive gingerbread to Christmassy coconut samosas.
