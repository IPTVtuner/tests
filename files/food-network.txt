James's final stop is in England's first National Park: The Peak District. He is joined by cooking legend Tessa Bramley, who serves him up a delicious beef fillet along with vegetables from her beautiful garden. James takes part in an unusual contest, hen racing, where he challenges a local lad and world champion to a race. After discovering some award-winning gin, James meets a local forager and samples some of his elderflower wine.
