For the first recipe Tom makes a big pot of beef mince, the starting point for some of the nation's favourite dishes. He uses a batch to make a delicious cottage pie, while the rest is frozen to be used later, perhaps for chili con carne, spaghetti bolognese or lasagne. Batch cooking at the weekend is a great way to save time in the week.
