Ainsley is inspired by the tastes and delights of the seaside - he starts with a taste of Italy making his Crab and Lemon Linguine with Pangrattato. He heads off on a seaside adventure with expert forager Alysia Vasey to find out what edible treats are growing on our shorelines, then uses some seaside herbs they forage in his Zesty Seafood Kebabs with Shaved Courgette and Fennel Salad in his shoreside kitchen.
