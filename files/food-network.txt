Mary shares her foolproof recipes for those days when you are simply run off your feet. Her mantra is "get organised, and try to do things ahead" and tonight the dishes she prepares are ones you can get together in no time. Tomato soup made from ingredients from the store cupboard, and express bacon and pesto pasta are perfect examples of dishes that take under 20 minutes to rustle up.
