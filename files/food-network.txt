This time at River Cottage the theme is treats, with everything from Genoese sponge cake and lemon curd muffins, to game pies and cheesy tarts on the menu. There is also real ginger beer, a revamped afternoon tea for the Bridport Tea Dance, a night out at the local pub featuring a pudding league, and Hugh's son Oscar gets in on the act with a vanilla and elderflower panna cotta.
