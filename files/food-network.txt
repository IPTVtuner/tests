Today, March 30
Mary explores the wonderful foods that bring each different community together on Easter Sunday, the most symbolic and meaningful feast in the Christian calendar. As well as sharing her own family favourites, like mouth-watering Roast Lamb, Mary discovers how the Greek Orthodox community break the fast with Tsoureki bread; spends a day with the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, cooking up a storm in his kitchen; and discovers Filipino and Italian Easter specialities.
