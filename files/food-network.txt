Ainsley is Egg-xited to explore the wonderful world of eggs. He kicks things off with a delicious breakfast hash with nduja and kale for a spicy start to the day. Ainsley stops in on old pal Marcus Bean to check out his farm shop and gets a quick lesson on custard tarts. Back in his kitchen Ainsley makes his own dessert, blueberry and almond clafoutis with cardamom cream.
