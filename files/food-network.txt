In Ainsley's kitchen, it's time for that Great British tradition: tea. Ainsley puts a modern twist on the old king of the dessert trolley, with black forest brownies with kirsch cream. Actor, singer and dancer John Partridge visits Ainsley in the kitchen, where he bakes up a storm with his sausage rolls. The lovely Candice Brown adds a naughty twist to teatime with her gin and tonic drizzle cake, accompanied with some rocky road cookies.
