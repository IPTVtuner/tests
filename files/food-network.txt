`The Great British Bake Off' makes its debut on Channel 4 as the series returns for an eighth season with 12 budding bakers competing to be crowned the champion. Established judge Paul Hollywood is joined by food connoisseur Prue Leith, while seasoned entertainers Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding take on the role of being the show's hosts. Despite the change in personnel, the key Bake Off traditions remain intact, as the contestants try to impress the panel with a fine selection of beautifully-crafted and delicious cakes, tarts, breads and more.
