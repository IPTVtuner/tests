Ainsley celebrates the unsung heroes of many wonderful meals - grains and pulses. He receives a masterclass in milling flour before using it to make a pizza margherita, and also cooks one of his favourite childhood treats - Caribbean cinnamon banana fritters with chocolate sauce dip. To finish, Ainsley creates a stove-top rice dish full of smoky, spicy flavours - a Creole Jambalaya.
