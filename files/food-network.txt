Raymond Blanc has made his home in the heart of the English countryside, and over the last three decades has seen the British food scene transformed. Blanc is celebrating this with an ingenious pea soup, a taste bud-tantalising stuffed pepper, and a new take on that old British classic, brown sauce. Raymond also gets to put his feet up as Paul Ainsworth presents an alternative cheese board.
