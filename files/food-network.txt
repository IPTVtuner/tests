Dave and Si are back in West Yorkshire cooking up a storm with the Slaithwaite ladies - proving that with passion, commitment and drive it is possible to reinvent `Meals on Wheels' and give it a real future. Later, the Bikers head back to Elmbridge to find out if all their hard work there has paid off and HRH the Duchess of Cornwall comes to see the work they have been doing and show her support.
