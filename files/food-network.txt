Food Network
Today, September 01
Dave Myers and Simon King seek to revive our British culinary national treasure. In the first episode, Dave and Si address the three biggest problems facing `Meals on Wheels' today - volunteer vacancies, the food and its out-dated/moth-eaten image. After a trip back in time to Welwyn Garden City where it all started in 1943 to help older victims of the Blitz, the Bikers saddle up and head off to Surrey.
