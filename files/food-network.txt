In Slaithwaite, West Yorkshire, Dave and Si find a village that's lost its traditional hot `Meals on Wheels' service. So together with a band of feisty Yorkshire ladies, they set about trying to start a new one of their own from scratch. It's a massive task, but the Bikers are prepared to go all the way to ensure hot fresh meals are once again delivered to Slaithwaite's older people.
