James welcomes fellow chef Martin Blunos to his old student stamping ground in Brittany. They park up their trailer near Vannes, where the fresh seafood in the old market catches their imagination. Loaded up with a fabulous trawl they head back to the campsite to cook up Pot Au Feu and cod cheeks in local beer batter with home made tartare sauce.
