James is joined by pal and Michelin-starred chef Mark Jordan, and together they set out to explore the delights of Jersey aboard mini motor bikes. James samples the delights of one of Jersey's most famous exports, the Jersey Royal potato, and he uses them to cook up a squid risotto with a difference. Mark Jordan gets a lesson in oyster shucking, and James discovers an island speciality: Jersey black butter, which he uses to create a delicious sweet treat.
