James returns to one of his favourite places in the UK: the beautiful county of Cornwall. Joining him is his close pal and Michelin-starred chef Galton Blackiston. During their trip they discover some world-class Cornish ice cream, and Galton visits Newlyn fish market to pick up some Cornish cod. James cooks the cod along with Cornish oysters and a warm tartare sauce. They both round off the day with a painting challenge on Sennen beach, where they try out their oil painting skills.
