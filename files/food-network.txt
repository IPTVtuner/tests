Ainsley kicks off his culinary trip down memory lane by showcasing dishes and recipes that celebrate holidays. Starting with a sensationally fresh spicy seafood linguine with chilli and cherry tomatoes, Ainsley is then joined by Alison Hammond, who cooks up a storm in the kitchen with a Tunisian-inspired lamb and couscous dish. Long-time friend Aldo Zilli also gives a masterclass in making a crispy chili and parsley calamari.
