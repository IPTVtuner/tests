Ainsley's Caribbean Kitchen travels to Dominica where the wild rainforests hide many waterfalls and rivers. Ainsley takes a trip to its most famous waterfall, the Emerald Pool. He then cooks up a storm on the black sands of Picard Beach, whipping up his tostones aka twice fried plantains. Ainsley visits Daria Eugene - an expert in Dominican cuisine, to learn about titiwi, tiny fish that gather in the rivers of Dominica at certain times of the month.
