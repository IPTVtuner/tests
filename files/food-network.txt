Join Ainsley and friends for some festive fun. Ainsley and pal Olly Smith get the fun started with canapes and cocktails, the perfect way to greet guests. Olly sticks around to keep the drinks flowing. Stage and screen star Shane Richie joins Ainsley while he cooks up a biryani, filled with flavour and a great way to use any left-over Christmas turkey. Chef and Ready Steady Cook star Brian Turner takes over the hob to cook up a delicious duck dish.
