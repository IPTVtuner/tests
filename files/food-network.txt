Si and Dave explore Leicstershire where they cook a traditional county favourite at Leicester Market. They visit the supermodels of the cow world and taste the king of cheeses, Stilton. Finally, they face the challenge of a cook-off against top chef, Sean Hope. Restaurant diners decide who has created the best taste of Leicestershire in a blind tasting.
