On the next leg of his UK tour, James is joined in glorious Devon by his friend and Michelin-starred chef Simon Hulstone. James visits an extraordinary mushroom farm situated in a bungalow, and makes a tasty steak and mushroom dish. Simon samples some award-winning cheese, which inspires James to make a cheese platter fit for a king. The day ends with a trip to the Art Deco splendour of Burgh Island.
