James is joined in Northern Ireland by his good pal and local boy Paul Rankin. They brave the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge together, then James cooks a tasty fish dish with the dramatic coastline as his backdrop. There's a fishing trip over to Rathlin Island on the menu too, where James tastes some dishes made from the local kelp. James and Paul then visit the Old Lammas Fair, where they taste some of the delicious seafood.
