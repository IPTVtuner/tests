James continues with a trip to an island that's not actually an island. Avery Island is a large salt mound and the home of the chili peppers that are used to make Tabasco sauce. James meets the family who farm the peppers, make the sauce and run the Tabasco company, and he's even granted access to the pepper fields to cook two amazing dishes.
