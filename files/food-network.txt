Nigel shows how combinations of ingredients that grow in the same place at the same time often make the ideal starting point for a dish. There is no need to write down complicated recipes as Nigel's unflustered style makes these feasts easy to remember. Nigel also visits local allotment holders and creates a tasty feast from the fruits of their labour.
