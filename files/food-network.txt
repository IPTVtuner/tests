Today, April 15
Today on Bake, Rachel shows you a recipe for wonderfully tasty mini beef pasties which have elements of Mexican empanadas, Indian samosas and classic English pasties all rolled into one. Rachel meets the doyenne of witty and romantic cakes. Peggy Porschen's creations are the stuff of little girls' fantasies: cascading sugar flowers and layers of cupcakes with old-fashioned sugar roses.
