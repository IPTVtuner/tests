The penultimate episode of Ainsley's Caribbean Kitchen sees the chef travel to Antigua to experience the island of sea and sun. His first stop is at the English Harbour, where he meets local historian Dr Reg Murphy to get an insight into the history of the island. Cocktails are the flavour of the day when Ainsley has a master class in being a mixologist from the head bartender at Carlisle Bay Hotel.
