Vegetables are the star of this episode as Ainsley heads to Hampshire to try his hand at harvesting asparagus before rustling up a brilliant one-pot asparagus and artichoke orzo. Joseph Denison Carey visits Norfolk to learn all about the radish, and on the beach, Ainsley knocks up a lemon and herb chicken flatties with creamy celeriac remoulade. Plus, to prove vegetables can be sweet too, Ainsley make his carrot, orange and rosemary loaf cake - a perfect afternoon treat.
