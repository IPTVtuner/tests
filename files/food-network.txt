Raymond Blanc shares his love of travel and embracing the influence of other cultures into his cuisine. An enrichment of his own French culture and cuisine he cooks a sensationally fresh flash fired squid, with a fennel and rocket salad, and later a miso and harissa aubergine with cous cous. Plus, chef and good friend Jos√© Pizarro visits and indulges Raymond with an alfresco worthy dish, pan fried salted cod with chickpeas, white beans and spinach stew.
