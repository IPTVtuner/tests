Fruits and berries take centre stage in Ainsley's dishes, including a jackfruit, butterbean and okra pimento pot, and Persian spatchcocked chicken with jewelled rice. Ainsley also meets Mel from OllyLolly to find out why she started her business making fruity lollies, and in celebration of British fruits, Ainsley makes a classic summer pudding.
