Ina's making over classic dishes and turning up the volume with new ingredients and cooking methods. By daring to be different Ina transforms dishes with a big flavour payoff. There's Easy parmesan risotto, deconstructed strawberry shortcakes and a new take on breakfast, Eggs Columbian, a favourite at local cafe and speciality food store Mary's Marvellous.
