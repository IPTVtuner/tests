Si and Dave explore Anglesey where they cook an ancient local favourite in Beaumaris, harvest mussels from the Menai Strait and sample some very special sea salt. Finally, armed with the finest of the area's ingredients, they go head to head in a cook-off with top local chef, Stephen Duffy. Restaurant diners will decide who has best defined the taste of Anglesey in a blind tasting.
