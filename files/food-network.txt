Nigel Slater looks at the role of contrasting temperatures in this programme, to show us how the marriage of something hot with something cold can turn a good dish into something really special. From a simple twist on the classic hot apple pie and ice cream, to a chip shop-inspired dish of sizzling fish with a lime and chilli 'vinegar', Nigel helps us to understand the role of hot and cold in cooking.
