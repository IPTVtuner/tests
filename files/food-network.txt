James is joined by Michelin-starred chef Kenny Atkinson, and they set out to sample the delights of Northumberland. They learn how mead is made on Holy Island, before James cooks up a Singapore-inspired crab and lobster dish on a stunning beach, and they both enjoy a Puffin cruise at Cockett Island. There's a trip to a lobster hatchery too, before James cooks local speciality Singing Hinnies on another breathtaking beach.
