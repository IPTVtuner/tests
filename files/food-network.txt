Si and Dave explore Shropshire, in Shrewsbury, collect game from a pheasant shoot and pick hedgerow berries. Finally, they use some of the best of the area's ingredients to go head to head in a cook-off with Michelin starred local chef, Will Holland. Restaurant diners decide who has created the dish that best defines Shropshire in a blind tasting.
