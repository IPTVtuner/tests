Today, August 19
Mary embraces the British countryside with fresh and honest bucolic cooking inspired by what is grown on farms and in gardens, from a joyous pasta inspired by a classic French herb sauce, to a perfect way to partner asparagus, and how to serve up the most scrumptious roasted vegetables. Mary makes her way through vegetable rows and orchards, ending with her own inspired version of the delicious tarte tatin.
