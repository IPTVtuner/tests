Penultimate film for Marilyn Monroe, with an off-stage story as interesting as its plotline of a wealthy industrialist who falls for an actress. Arthur Miller heavily rewrote wife Monroe's part, so leading man Gregory Peck walked out. His replacement Yves Montand then enjoyed a fleeting fling with his blonde co-star.
