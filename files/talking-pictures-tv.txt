Chilling hybrid of black humour and gore set in the US during the 19th century as a stranger arrives at a remote military outpost, claiming to be the sole survivor of a group who became stranded and resorted to cannibalism for survival. Setting out to investigate his claims, the soldiers discover that the truth is even more disturbing than the wanderer's story.
