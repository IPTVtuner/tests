Sir John Falstaff is the hero in a compilation of extracts from Shakespeare's `Henry IV' and other plays, made into a connected story of Falstaff's career as young Prince Hal's drinking companion. Set in late medieval England, the massive Knight roisters with and without the Prince, philosophises comically, goes to war (in his own fashion), and meets his final disappointment.
