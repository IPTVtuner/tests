Ordered to take control of a Japanese-held Pacific island, a unit of new US Marine recruits take terrible losses as they storm ashore and push inland through the jungle. As the enemy launches a counterattack, unflinching scenes of battle contrast with the lush scenery and flashbacks to civilian life of both the American and Japanese combatants.
