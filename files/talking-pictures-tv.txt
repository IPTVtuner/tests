Set along the Texan border, American army captain Rod Douglas leads his men against a gang of Mexican bandits, who have been making frequent raids across the divide. The bandits, led by General Hector Cordoba, steal a huge cannon from the army and in response a crack mission unit are sent to get the cannon back and capture the rebel-leader alive.
