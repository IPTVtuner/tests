Fritz Lang's powerful film of human lust and desire is based on Emile Zola's novel `La BÃªte Humaine'. Railroad worker Carl Buckley asks his wife Vicki to beg her lover John Owens to use his influence to save his job. She succeeds but when Buckley sees them together, he kills Owens in a fit of jealous rage and brutally dominates her, blackmailing her with a letter that implicates her in the murder.
