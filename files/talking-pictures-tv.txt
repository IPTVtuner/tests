A young Catholic priest adheres to a rare form of the faith. When he learns of the strange death of his mentor, he travels to Rome with a fellow priest and a woman - who once tried to kill him during an exorcism - to investigate the mystery. What he finds is the truth behind the myth of the Sin Eater, an immortal figure who takes on the sins of the damned to ensure their passage into Heaven.
