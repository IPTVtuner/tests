British crime drama following the trial of four youths accused of robbing and murdering a nightwatchman. With the prospect of the death penalty being given should the boys be found guilty, the defence lawyer attempts to convince the jury to come to a charitable verdict. While the witnesses' evidence seems to prove their guilt, when the accused give their version of the night's events, an entirely different picture emerges.
