For generations, the Whitlocks and the Laniers have been feuding, including when Vanessa Whitlock, accused of being a witch, was buried alive centuries ago. Now Bill Lanier wants to dig up a burial ground for development purposes, and Morgan Whitlock tries to stop him. Soon, unexplainable accidents start to happen to members of the Lanier family, throwing suspicion on Morgan. The real truth Bill discovers is much more sinister than he expected.
