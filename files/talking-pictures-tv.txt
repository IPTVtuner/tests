Taxi driver Tom Manning is caught out in an April Fool's joke played on him by a group of small children. One girl, Irene Evans, pretends she has lost her doll on some waste ground. When Attenborough discovers he's been hoaxed, he pretends to be angry and chases Irene. When the little girl is later found murdered, several people have witnessed Manning `threatening' the infant and circumstantial evidence also links him to the crime.
