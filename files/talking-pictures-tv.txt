When the Germans invade Poland, a celebrated pianist loses his job because he is Jewish, but as the Nazis tighten their grip on Warsaw, his family are thrown out of their home and forced to live in the ghetto. As conditions turn even more nightmarish, the pianist hides in the ruined city, dodging the squads who carry off Jews to the death camps.
