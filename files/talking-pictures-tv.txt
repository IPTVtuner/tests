It's summer of 1925 and Richard Bellamy is anxious to be appointed to the post of Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He thinks that the influential millionaire Sir Guy Paynter may be able to help him, so he asks Virginia to invite him to lunch, much to her dismay. However, when the tabloids link Virginia and Guy romantically, Richard is forced to ask that Virginia stop seeing him.
