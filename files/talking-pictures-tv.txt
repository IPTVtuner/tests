Today, September 19
Torvald and Nora Helmer have been married for eight years and, on the surface at least, their marriage seems exceptionally happy; they have three children, a comfortable home and a healthy income. When Kristine Linde, an old school friend of Nora's, a widow, penniless but independent-minded, arrives in town and calls on Nora, she gradually discovers that all is not as tranquil and well-ordered as it seems.
