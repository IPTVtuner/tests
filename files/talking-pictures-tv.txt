One autumn weekend, early in WWII at an aircraft factory at Broughton in North Wales, a group of British workers set out to smash a world record for building a bomber from scratch. They managed to build a Wellington Bomber in 23 hours and 50 minutes. So who were the men and women who made this record-breaking Wellington? This programme has traced six of them, one of whom was only 14 years old.
