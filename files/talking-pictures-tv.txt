Two music students, rather than face the responsibilities of life, repeatedly fail their exams so that they can stay in college. The students change their attitude, however, when they meet a woman who agrees to be their manager and both attempt to woo her as a way of getting a job in Artie Shaw's band. Featuring the Oscar-nominated `Would You Like to Be the Love of My Life?'.
