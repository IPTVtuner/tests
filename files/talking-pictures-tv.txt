Set in Yorkshire at the dawn of the 20th century, this is the story of three children whose father has been wrongfully imprisoned for espionage, though they know nothing of this; their mother refuses to tell them why the police took away their father. So, the children spend their free time exploring the mystery of their father's disappearance and gazing at the nearby railroad in the hope that it will somehow bring them an answer.
