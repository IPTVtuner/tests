As the dynamic duo speeds back to the Batcave, Batman suspects foul play because of a comment made by the trustee dealing with the Batmobile's speed, and he immediately stops the car and disables a car-bomb just before it can go off! Quick as a blink, the peerless pair speed back to the prison to check on The Parkers. However, clever playacting convinces them that all is well there.
