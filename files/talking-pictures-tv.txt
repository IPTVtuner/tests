World War II-era Berlin is a treacherous place for a young woman, something Erika Angermann comes to learn firsthand. Not long after she provides sanctuary for escaped American prisoner of war Foster MacLain, a bomb destroys her home, killing her father and pitching her onto the streets. Now on her own, Erika seeks refuge but must repeatedly flee from threats of rape and white slavery. Then comes a fateful reunion with a grateful MacLain.
