At 18, Peter Henderson takes control of the family business. He becomes suspicious of one of the managers, Cartwright, who plans to tear down a decrepit building and build an office block. Going to the condemned building, Peter finds it a refuge for the homeless and realises not just that some things are more important than profit, but that Cartwright and his conspirators have been defrauding his company for years.
