In 1905, a rebellion on India's north west frontier threatens the life of a young Hindu prince. Captain Scott, a British officer, rescues the boy and sets out with a small group on an old locomotive, making a perilous journey through rebel territory, but Scott and his passengers are faced not just with the marauding tribesmen, but also a traitor in their midst.
