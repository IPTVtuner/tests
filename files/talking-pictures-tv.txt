The true story of Franz von Werra of the Luftwaffe, captured when he crashed his Messerschmitt in 1940. Taken before an interrogating officer, he bet a magnum of champagne against ten cigarettes that he would escape in six months and made two audacious attempts to get away, succeeding at the third when, part of a group of prisoners being transferred to Canada, he escaped and crossed into the neutral United States.
