GI Fairchild questions the right to kill another human being, The Preacher sees everything in strict terms of good and evil, and the comedy element comes from Dooley, who runs a floating crap game with the intention of raising enough money to set up a fancy restaurant in New York. The love interest comes from Fiamma, who Fairchild and Dooley set up for The Preacher, only for a genuine relationship to develop.
