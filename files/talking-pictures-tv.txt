Frank Pierce, a New York ambulance driver, has worked in one of the city's most brutal neighbourhoods for years, and the pressure of the job has taken its toll. Plagued with self-doubt, he is haunted by the spirits of the people he was not able to save, and while he desperately wants to quit his job, outside forces won't let him walk away.
