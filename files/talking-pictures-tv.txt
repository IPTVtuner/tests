To save a young girl's life, there is a frantic search for a rare blood. Only three people can be identified who are able to provide the blood, and each must be persuaded to make the donation despite reservations: a sailor about to depart for the Orient, a boxer in trouble for refusing to throw the big fight, and a murderer who has been a fugitive for 12 years.
