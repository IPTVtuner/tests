A man is released from jail after serving 12 years for a murder he didn't commit. Determined to seek revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment, he at first shuts himself away in a deserted barge on the Thames Estuary where he is kept under police surveillance and hounded by pressmen after a story. Only a pathetic refugee girl is slowly able to get through to him.
