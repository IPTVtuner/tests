Today, June 28
Two years earlier, a rare metal isotope important in nuclear weapons development was stolen from the U.S. Otto Silff, involved in the theft, was killed by his co-conspirator, Major Johan. Johan is planning to sell the isotope to an Asian nation that is also an enemy of the U.S. To recover the isotope before the sale takes place, Paris poses as Silff, supposedly having had a disfiguring injury with plastic surgery, and suffering from amnesia -- but unconsciously displaying Otto's characteristics.
