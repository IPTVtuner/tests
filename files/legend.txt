A true story of two remaining officers desperately trying to rally their meagre force of 105 men against 4,000 attacking Zulu warriors. Cetewayo, ruler of the Zulu kingdom, begins his war against the white invaders with the annihilation of the British army at Isandhlwana and moves on to his next target - the depleted garrison at Rorke's Drift.
