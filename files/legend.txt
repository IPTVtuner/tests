Legend
Today, April 07
Blackly comic variation on the classic tale, in which the good doctor, experimenting with ways to prolong life, tests the formula on himself and metamorphoses into a beautiful woman. His alter ego turns out to have a very nasty streak, killing prostitutes who, terrified of Jack the Ripper, believe they have nothing to fear from a woman.
