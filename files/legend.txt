Legend
Today, April 22
A disfigured petty criminal is given plastic surgery in prison and, unrecognisable as his former self, plans his revenge on the ruthless associates who betrayed him. The doctor hopes the painful operations which give Johnny a new look will help him to reform, but he is bent on settling the score with the gang who killed his only friend and left him to carry the can for their last heist.
