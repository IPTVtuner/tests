A New York police lieutenant is addicted to drugs, alcohol and gambling and up to his neck in debt. He's also one of the city's finest and when a nun is brutally raped, his desire to find the rapist is tempered by the $50,000 reward on offer. Abel Ferrara pulls out of Harvey Keitel one of his finest performances.
