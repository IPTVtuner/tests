Today, October 16
In the near future, global warming turns parts of the American Midwest into a desert. In its attempt to take hold of the economic recession, a government agency called the Humanity Bureau exiles members of society deemed unproductive, and banishes them to a colony known as New Eden. An ambitious and impartial caseworker Noah Kross investigates a case appealed by a single mother and her son. Knowing the unjust fate of the innocent boy, Kross sets off to save the lives of the mother and child.
