Chinese cop Liu Jian is brought to Paris to help crack a major drugs ring, but when the official with whom he's meant to liaise ends up dead, he realises that corrupt cop Jean-Pierre Richard is the head of the ring. Jian must not only prove he is innocent of the murder but also evade Richard's thugs who want him dead. In a city where he knows nobody, Jian's only ally is a prostitute named Jessica.
