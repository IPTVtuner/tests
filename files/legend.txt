Legend
Today, February 19
A disgraced ex-policeman scrapes a living as a private detective working mainly on divorce cases. When a supposedly routine case goes wrong and leads to the murder of a client and his own wife, he is under suspicion of murder. His enquiries lead him to the murdered client's mistress, and as he becomes increasingly involved with her, he must fight to defend both his name and his life.
