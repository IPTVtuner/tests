An unlikely partnership is formed by an insurance investigator and an ageing cat burglar. When a heavily guarded work of art is stolen, the insurance investigator persuades her employers to let her go undercover and team up with a master thief. The thief sets the woman a rigorous training programme before they embark on a series of robberies against an emotional backdrop of distrust and growing attraction.
