Legend
Today, May 09
Set in the Thatcher years of the 1980s, Frankie is on the run from the high-rise flats of South London to a new life in Malaga with nothing but a tin stuffed full of cash. Having no idea that this delivery of cash to super-suave playboy and ex-con Charlie will change his life forever, he soon becomes one of the gang, and finds himself drawn into a flamboyant and violent world of organised crime.
