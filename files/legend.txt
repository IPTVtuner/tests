Today, October 02
Two strangers share a ride home from university in heavy snow when, on a narrow and treacherous shortcut to the freeway, a mysterious car forces them into a snowbank. With the car damaged and the wintry weather preventing them from walking for help, they soon become aware of a ghostly and malevolent presence around them.
