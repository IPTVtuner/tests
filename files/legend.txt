Yuri Orlov is an opportunistic businessman who stumbled into a gold mine after the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. As Soviet military technology disappeared, it began finding its way into the hands of weapons dealers like Orlov who found buyers in unstable Third World nations. His exploits quickly made him a very rich man, but Interpol agent Jack Valentine is convinced he isn't playing by the rules.
