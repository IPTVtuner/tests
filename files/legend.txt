Legend
Today, September 22
At the wedding of his daughter (Amy Stock-Poynton), retired marshal Matt Dillon (James Arness) is shockingly charged with a murder he did not commit. Instead of a honeymoon, the newlyweds must instead flee with Dillon and try to help him clear his name by finding the real murderer. As a bounty-hunting posse pursues hot on their heels, the trio receives help from two unlikely sources: prostitute Uncle Jane Merkel (Ali MacGraw) and preacher John Parsley (James Brolin).
