Today, February 12
A veteran detective is teamed with a rookie cop when they are sent to negotiate with a bunch of criminals holding a bank hostage. It transpires that a master thief has planted a computer virus that will drain funds from the bank's accounts. The detective faces a race against time to catch the thief and stop the randomly evolving computer virus, which models its behaviour on the bewildering principles of chaos theory.
