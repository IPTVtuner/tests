Jim Gordon is the head of a group of American pilots working for the Chinese government against the invading Japanese two years prior to Pearl Harbour. Hothead Woody Jason joins them but despite being a hotshot flyer, he's also a liability. When he causes the death of veteran pilot Hap Smith, the rest ostracise him and only an ultimate sacrifice will wipe the slate clean.
