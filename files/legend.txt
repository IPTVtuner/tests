Today, January 02
Miami's top mob enforcer, Cuda, sacrifices it all to tear down the criminal organisation he's spent his whole life building up when he discovers his boss, Estelle, is putting a young runaway's life in grave danger. Now, he has one last chance to make up for his past and find redemption -- both for himself and his family -- before the mob hunts him down for his betrayal.
