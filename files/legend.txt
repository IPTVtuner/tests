A drifter chooses to stop in the wrong town when his beloved Mustang develops engine trouble. Things seem to pick up when sultry Grace McKenna asks him home to help fix her curtains - until her husband Jake finds out. Jake then asks Cooper to kill Grace, but she has her own plans for Jake. Cooper, caught in the middle, had better choose the right side or he risks losing his life.
