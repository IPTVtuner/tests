Set in the Libyan desert in 1942 where a group of American soldiers become isolated in their tank during the retreat to El Alamein. As they drive across the desert they pick up a group of Allied stragglers, but with their supplies of fuel, food and water running low, they try to reach a desert fortress, but a large German detachment is also heading there.
