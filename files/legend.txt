Today, October 16
A quadriplegic who alleviates his boredom by spying on nearby apartments comes to believe that a neighbour has murdered his wife. He confides in a colleague who has taken over his work and even tells a detective, but neither they nor other neighbours share his conviction. Can he prove that his suspicion is well-founded? Based on a story by Cornell Woolrich, originally filmed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1954.
