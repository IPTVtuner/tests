Legend
Today, April 29
Evan Treborn, a gifted psychology student who harbours terrible childhood secrets, discovers he can go back in time through the pages of his childhood diary, and does so to alter his destiny and those of his friends Kayleigh and Tommy. However, every time he returns to the future, he finds that what he hoped would be cured in the past has, in some cases, gone horribly wrong.
