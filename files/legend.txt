MacShayne is back, and is now the in-house detective at a glitzy Las Vegas hotel. His hands are full watching over the hotel CEO's grandson, who is a kleptomaniac. Then, MacShayne tries to calm down a nightclub singer performing at the hotel, who is having difficulties with her ex-husband, and who happens to be the bass player for her band. When the singer's ex-husband is found dead, she becomes the prime suspect.
