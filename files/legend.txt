Legend
Today, November 19
Visually arresting thriller about a researcher who uses a mentally disabled gardener for ill-advised experiments in inducing mental development through virtual reality simulations. At first, the simulations seem to enhance the lawnmower man's mental powers, but then the experiment goes haywire. Based on a short story by Stephen King.
