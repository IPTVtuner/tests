Today, March 13
Two Arkansas firemen learn from a dying man that he hid a stash of gold in a disused warehouse 50 years earlier in an East St Louis ghetto. When they go in search of the loot, the pair unwittingly observes a murder carried out by the local mob and become targets themselves, especially when it becomes known why they happen to be in the area in the first place.
