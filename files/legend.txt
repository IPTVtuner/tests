Legend
Today, March 27
Two bickering siblings drive from college across America. Pulling over to investigate a parked truck that had previously tried to run them off the road, they see a strangely garbed figure dumping what looks like a dead body. Investigating, they stumble across an ancient, indestructible horror and look set to become the next victims, unless the advice of a psychic can save them.
