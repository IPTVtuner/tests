When Bowen Tyler was marooned on the lost island of Caprona in the year 1916 in the first film of this loose trilogy, `The Land That Time Forgot', he hurled a cannister into the ocean hoping someone would find it and come to his rescue. Three years later the cannister, containing Tyler's information about the island and prehistoric botanical specimens, is discovered off the coast of Scotland.
