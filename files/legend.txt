Legend
Today, September 28
Deep in space, the crew of the Enterprise begin to question the apparently irrational behaviour of their captain. When Kirk inexplicably orders a change of course which results in a potentially fatal encounter with the Romulans, Spock is forced to use the Vulcan death grip on his superior.
