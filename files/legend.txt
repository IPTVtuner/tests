Today, June 28
Anton Malek is a mole sent years ago to monitor an Iron Curtain nuclear program. Suffering from a terminal illness Malek has become a rogue agent, and rigged a nuclear reactor to explode. Convinced by the team that his illness can be cured, Malek (unknowingly) disassembles an IMF replica of the bomb, while Barney mimics his procedure on the real device. But, Phelps suddenly realizes that Malek has discovered the deception; forcing the team to rely on intuition alone in disarming the bomb.
