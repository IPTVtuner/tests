Today, March 10
Two US marines who fought together in war are reunited in a battle against the military. When one of the men is threatened with court martial for his involvement in the death of 83 civilians, he calls on his former colleague, who is embittered by his Vietnam injuries, to act as his attorney. As the men seek revenge against the military system, a high-level political conspiracy unravels.
