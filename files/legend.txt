US contractor Paul is working in Iraq when one day, after an attack by a group of Iraqis, he wakes up to find he has been buried alive inside a coffin, somewhere in the desert. With just a cigarette lighter and a mobile phone on him, he must somehow find a way to escape before the air supply runs out.
