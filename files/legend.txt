Legend
Today, June 27
Set in the not-too-distant future when aliens, labelled `newcomers' by humans, have settled on Earth but have yet to integrate fully into society due to their hosts' prejudice. When the partner of a tough LA cop is murdered by an alien, he reluctantly agrees to work with a `newcomer' in a bid to track down the killer, but the unlikely pair soon uncover evidence of a plot which threatens to destroy both their species.
