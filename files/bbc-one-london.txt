Gary Lineker presents all the goals, drama and reaction from the day's six Premier League fixtures, including the blockbuster clash between Liverpool and Arsenal at Anfield. This is a fixture that rarely disappoints, and last season was no different, with nine goals scored across their two league meetings. Arsenal edged a thrilling encounter 3-2 at the Emirates, before Liverpool battled back from 2-0 down to draw at home in a result that proved damaging to the Gunners' title hopes.
