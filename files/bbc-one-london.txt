Jacqui visits Broadstairs in Kent, a favourite holiday destination of Charles Dickens, to see a two-bedroom basement garden flat bought by an experienced developer. Martin returns to Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire to revisit a fire-damaged two-bed terrace he first saw in 2021, and he also heads to Tonypandy in south Wales to visit a four-storey building with potential to convert into separate flats.
