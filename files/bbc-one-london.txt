Martin heads to Cannock in Staffordshire to see a three-bed bungalow with a bizarre layout, taken on by a husband and wife who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty. He also visits Alsager in Cheshire to see a three-bed semi with lots of space, it's just in all the wrong places. And Martel is in Hartlepool, County Durham, to visit a two-bed terrace in need of modernisation.
