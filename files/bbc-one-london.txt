The roadshow visits Thirlestane Castle in the Scottish Borders, where treasures include a Rod Stewart gold disc, a silver chalice thought to have been found in a potato field, and a gold, enamelled snuffbox gifted by a Russian tsar. Katherine Wright and Charlotte Riordan discover two artworks featuring Thirlestane Castle itself - a 19th-century embroidered sampler and a rare watercolour by Borders artist Tom Scott.
