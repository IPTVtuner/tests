They say an Englishman's home is his castle, and today Jules Hudson catches up with two couples who have bought their very own slice of stately-home living, at either end of the financial scale. He meets a couple who bought one of the beautiful houses they viewed on their original 2019 Escape to the Country property hunt. One year on, he finds out how they've settled into country life and whether they managed to find a good curry house in the countryside.
