In this show, every question is a picture, and you need to know something about everything to get a Picture Slam and win big. Contestants need to name all the pictures on their board for a Picture Slam and a chance to take home Â£10,000 in the final. Playing this week are couple Rosie and Bekah from Brighton, friends Ciaran and Ethan from Belfast, and childhood pals Tony and Dalv.
