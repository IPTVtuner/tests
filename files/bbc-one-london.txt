The Ministry of Defence is not only responsible for the nation's security, but they are also one of the UK's major landowners. Charlotte and Matt have security clearance to enter their largest site, Salisbury Plain, where they find out how the MoD maintain a balance between military training, farming and conservation. Matt dons his waders and meets a team looking after a threatened and vitally important chalk river.
