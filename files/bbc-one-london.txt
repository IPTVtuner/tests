Tonight, it's the last quarter-final, and the week's best chefs return to do battle once more. They all want a place in knockout week, but to get there they'll have to impress the judges, as well as some special guest diners who might just know a thing or two about food. It's the invention test first, and this time the judges would like a dish centered around beetroot. They can raid the larder for anything they like, as long as the beetroot is shown off in its best light.
