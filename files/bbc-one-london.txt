Today, September 30
This film celebrates a supremely insightful, funny and sharp-eyed chronicler of our lives and times: Dame Jilly Cooper. Having sold over 12 million books, few other British writers have so consistently held up a mirror to the British as we really are - to our sex lives, class obsessions and the messy reality of our relationships. What does her extraordinary half-century of work reveal - not just about her world but about ourselves?
