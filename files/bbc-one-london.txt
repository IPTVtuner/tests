Hosted by Joel Dommett, the ultimate physical and psychological game continues as the remaining seven players compete to outwit, outplay and outlast their rivals to win Â£100,000 and the title of Sole Survivor. There are major repercussions for one player as the tribe tries to pick up the pieces from last night's shock Tribal Council. As the big moves get more and more ruthless, a mysterious item washes up on shore that could change the course of the game for the castaways.
