Mark Wright and his team, Karla Pryce and Asher Edwards, step in to help Gloria's family, whose home was devastated by a flood. A year later, their living room is still a dumping ground, and the kitchen is chaotic. With clever decluttering, custom storage solutions and a vibrant feature wall, the team transform the house into a warm, functional space. From a playful coffee table to ingenious kitchen storage, they bring joy, style and order back to Gloria's home.
