Suffolk is today's destination for Steve Brown and a couple from London who have Â£575,000 to spend on a new home from where they want to kick-start their new life in the countryside. Steve also meets an inspirational pair of young farmers who, despite having full-time jobs elsewhere, find time to farm 70 acres using ethical and sustainable methods.
