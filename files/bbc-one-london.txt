Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. The first visitor to the barn is Ed Hammond, with a damaged telescope to focus the attention of optics expert Richard Biggs. The telescope, complete with a worn leather case, belonged to Ed's father. He and Ed would spend hours looking at the moon and stars together, talking about astrology and adventure.
