Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Today's first arrival is Diane Davies from Bolton, with a cherished pair of football boots that symbolise triumph over adversity. They belonged to her late father and are in desperate need of cobbler Dean Westmoreland's expertise. Diane's dad was a keen football player and a devoted fan before he was called up for service in the Second World War.
