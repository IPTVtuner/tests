Fiona Bruce and the team are at Windermere Jetty Museum in the Lake District, where finds include a valuable collection of silver trophies awarded to a pioneering woman sailor, a James Bond poster scraped off a wall, a guitar rescued from a skip, a wooden dinghy from the film Swallows and Amazons, and a pair of `lost' necklaces with surprising values. Fiona finds out about the daredevils who have attempted to set speed records on the lakes.
