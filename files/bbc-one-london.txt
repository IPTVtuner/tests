On today's show, Danny takes a tour of Sheffield Botanical Gardens, where trustee Jill Sinclair shows him some of the 5,000 species of plants and trees that inhabit this urban oasis. Created in the early 19th century, the gardens were once home to a captive bear and monkeys! In more recent times, they fell into disrepair before being restored in 2007. Up the road in Wetherby, two teams gallop around the racecourse in search of bargains to sell at auction.
