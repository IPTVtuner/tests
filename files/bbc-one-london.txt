In 2022, Ellie Wilson's ex-boyfriend Daniel McFarlane was convicted of raping her twice during their relationship. They had met at their university athletics club, and Ellie had thought Daniel was 'the one', the perfect boyfriend. But one night, after returning from a running competition, Daniel raped Ellie. Then, he revealed that he'd done it before, when she was asleep. Determined to have proof of what he'd done, Ellie secretly recorded Daniel's admission on her phone.
