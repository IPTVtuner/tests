The teams need to name them all for a Picture Slam. Playing this week are best friends Gaynor and Natalie from Sheffield, sisters Mica and Elodie from London and father-and-son duo Isaac and Gordon from Dorset. They'll be battling it out across four rounds against the clock, including the new Picture Twist and buzzer rounds, to make it to the final Super Slam and a chance to win Â£10,000. Do they know their trombone from their Emma Stone?
