Sonali Shah helps a couple from a Surrey town who want to escape to the Welsh Borders for a quieter pace of life. They are hoping to use their Â£620,000 budget to purchase a characterful country home. Away from the property search, Sonali visits the Slimbridge Wetland Centre in Gloucestershire and goes behind the scenes with the conservation team preserving Britain's natural wetlands and its wildlife.
