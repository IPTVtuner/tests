Jay Blades and the team revive three cherished family heirlooms, triggering precious memories of the past. Amanda Fisher is the first to arrive, with a shattered jewellery box that she is praying Will Kirk can somehow salvage. The 1960s red velvet-lined box was her mother's and was gifted to Amanda on her sixteenth birthday. She was very close to her mum and has coveted the box ever since, especially as it used to play a tune each time you opened the lid.
