Who hacked M&S and Co-op? We go inside the cyber-attacks that shook the British high street and ask how flaws in digital defences were exposed. Why do criminals target companies in this way? We speak directly with the hackers behind the attacks and learn what data they've stolen. And what impact do these hacks have on a brand's reputation? We hear first-hand from the customers who were left scrambling and staff who had to deal with angry patrons.
