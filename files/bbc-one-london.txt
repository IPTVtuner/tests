Hosted by Joel Dommett, the ultimate physical and psychological game continues as the remaining ten players compete to outwit, outplay and outlast their rivals to win Â£100,000 and be crowned the Sole Survivor. After a drama-filled Tribal Council, the players try to figure out who can be trusted and, crucially, who can't. With the game now changed, tensions are rising, and the stakes are higher than ever before.
