When a missing woman is found buried in her own back garden, family and friends raise suspicions about her long-term boyfriend. But police don't have much to go on - until he flees to Estonia. It's only when some special CCTV comes to light that they have their moment of proof. Also, in Cheshire, police investigating a spate of burglaries have loads of CCTV of their man - they just don't know who he is. That is before they get the DNA results from a headtorch he's accidentally dropped.
