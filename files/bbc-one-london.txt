Jackie Kay is one of Britain's most loved and lauded poets. She is also a playwright and writer and from 2016 until 2021 was Scotland's Makar, the National Poet for Scotland. Her unique and emotive work spans race, gender and identity, woven with tenderness and humour, often drawing from her own unusual beginnings. Jackie recounts her extraordinary life story: born to a Scottish mother and Nigerian father, she was adopted as a baby by Helen and John Kay.
