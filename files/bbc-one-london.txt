It's a showdown in the Isle of Wight's shops for Catherine and Ishy, as they take their Toyota Starlet to the sunny seaside. This time they're both in search of Lady Luck, with Catherine opting for a wishbone and Ishy trying out some horseshoes. In Ryde, Catherine splashes out on a 19th-century birdbath, and Ishy goes quackers for some pewter ducks. Taking to the beach, our duo walk in the footsteps of dinosaurs, uncovering the oldest find of the trip by far.
