Stacey Solomon and her gang - organizer Dilly, carpenter Rob and cleaner Iwan - challenge the Harris-Hawley family to sort their lives out in seven days. They ask the family to try to let go of half their possessions so that the team can then beautifully reorganise their home. Stacey gets to know the family behind the clutter - childhood sweethearts Dan and Char and their two daughters, Mia (11) and Cece (3) - who rent a two-up, two-down from their local council.
