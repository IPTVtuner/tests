Gloria Hunniford and Julia Somerville hear the story of a woman from Bolton who staged a protest at the local branch of her bank after being left penniless and with no access to her money when the promise of a quick and easy switch of current accounts went disastrously wrong. And we hear from the rural customers of a leading supplier of off-grid liquid gas who say they feel short-changed over pricing and a lack of regulation.
