Today, January 10
Rob Brydon is back in the host's chair for the award-winning comedy panel show, with Lee Mack and David Mitchell returning as the lightning-quick team captains.

Sorting the fact from the fiction this week are guest panellists Harry Hill, Kojey Radical, Jill Scott and Stacey Solomon.
