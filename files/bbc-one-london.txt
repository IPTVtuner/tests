When Siobhan's car is stolen, Marlene spearheads the investigation - despite the fact she's got the day off to get married. Is the bride-to-be just suffering from pre-wedding nerves or is she realising that she's made a terrible mistake? Marlene's uncle Barry is also stressed out. He's worried the church authorities will find out he's officiating at an unauthorised same-sex wedding blessing. Little does he know that Nicole has invited the bishop.
