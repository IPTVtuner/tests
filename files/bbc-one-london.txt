Nigel Havers welcomes sellers of collectables and curiosities to the Bidding Room's new home in Edinburgh, where they ply their wares to five dealers. First through the doors are twin sisters Linda and Nicola with a healthy group of glass fruit and vegetables. Started from a single gift from sister Nicola, Linda has built the collection over a number of years, but now she's ready to sell them on to make space on her dining table.
