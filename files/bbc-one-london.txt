Today, September 28
Tess and Claud welcome our brand new couples back to the dance floor, and while they're all still hoping for high scores from the judges, tonight they are dancing for your votes at home. The judges' scores from the last two weeks will be combined, and at the end of the show, the public vote will open for the first time this series. Who will you be voting for?
