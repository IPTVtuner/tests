Three generations of the same family need help from Jules Hudson to find them a new home in rural Norfolk. In the kitty is Â£800,000 for a four-bedroom house, an annexe for Granny and enough land for a Shetland pony. Jules also needs a keen eye to spot some of the world's rarest, and most camera-shy, deer and antelope at a local safari park.
