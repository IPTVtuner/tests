It's the last of the knockouts and time for the MasterChef pop-up to open its doors once more for the second group of five chefs. It's their chance to show the who's who of the pop-up world that they mean business, as they serve up delicious dishes to those who know what it takes to succeed in the industry. The contestants will need to bring their A-game, as the dish voted the tastiest will land its creator an immediate place in the semi-finals.
