Being a superhero isn't as much fun as it used to be, especially when the people you've saved start to sue you. So the Incredible family go into the Superhero Relocation Programme and become a dull suburban family called the Parrs. Unfortunately Mr Incredible is tricked by an old enemy, so it's up to his talented family to rescue him and everyone else. A Pixar animation.
