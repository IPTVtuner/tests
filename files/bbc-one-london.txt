Knockout week continues and the ten remaining professionals are split into two groups. The contenders step out of the MasterChef kitchen for the very first time, cooking for their toughest crowd yet, and then return to compete for a place in the semi-finals. In this edition, five chefs take over Market Halls in central London, which is the home of some of the country's most exciting and eclectic food pop-up stalls.
