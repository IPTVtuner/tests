Clive takes on the star goal scorer for ACF Fiorentina's women's team in a penalty shoot-out. Back in the city, he indulges his passion for fashion - his mum Lynne was a seamstress for Burberry, and his first job was on Black Beauty and Hair magazine - by getting a masterclass in Italian menswear. Clive also discovers why italics are so Italian as he designs a wedding card for his niece Lucy.
