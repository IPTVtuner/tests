Great Britain will be looking to get among the medals early on day four in Paris as Alex Yee goes for gold in the men's triathlon. Yee had to settle for silver in Tokyo three years ago but won the test event on the Paris course last year and will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of Alistair Brownlee as Britain's second Olympic men's individual triathlon champion.
