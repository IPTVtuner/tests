A celebration of some of Longleat's legendary animals - in particular, Thorn the giraffe. Many of the keepers have cared for Thorn for over a decade, and in that time, the 5.5 metre giant has perhaps done more to ensure the future of his species than any other animal - fathering an astonishing 29 Rothschild giraffe calves. But now, aged 23, time is tragically catching up with Thorn.
