A thief who prowls for victims on social media is locked up, thanks to the sheath of his knife. His online accounts contain evidence of the violent crime spree. Also, a plea for help scrawled on a Â£10 note puts two kidnappers behind bars. Detectives race to track down the victim while the offenders subject him to a torturous ordeal.
