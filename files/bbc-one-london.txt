Dion heads to Crewe in Cheshire to see a two-bed end terrace, bought by a theatre nurse to renovate for her son and granddaughter to live in. We also revisit a three-storey building in Lower Gornal, West Midlands, which Dion first saw in 2018. It had planning permission to convert it into two flats, but has it finally been finished? Martel is in Hull to see a three-bed mid-terrace where ivy has made its way from the outside in.
