Leominster in Herefordshire is the location for today's programme. Christina Trevanion is in charge, with experts Kate Bliss and Ochucko Ojiri helping the red and blue teams as they spend Â£300 looking for bargains. Christina also finds out about the town's hat- and glove-making history. As usual, the teams face profits and losses at the auction, but which team will come out on top?
