It's Christmas at The Repair Shop, and the team face four festive fixes. Arriving first is Steve from Chesterfield, whose brought with him a Christmas treat to which there's more than meets the eye! The unassuming looking Christmas cake is not actually a baked desert, but a mechanical marvel created by Steven's uncle Fred back in the 1940s. Fred, who had an engineering background, loved to entertain, and this cake was an annual highlight for the whole family.
