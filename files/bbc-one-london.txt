To call the Ricketts' back yard in Christchurch, Dorset, a garden is an insult to gardens! It has no plants, no grass and no privacy. It's far from the colourful, private space the family want. But while they hate the garden's wall-to-wall concrete, mum Rebecca, who works in recycling, doesn't want it all going to landfill. So the challenge facing Charlie Dimmock and the Rich brothers is to turn an ugly concrete space into a beautiful, colourful garden that promotes recycling.
