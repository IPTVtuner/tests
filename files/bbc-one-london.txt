Martel is in Derbyshire to meet a young brother and sister who have bought a bijou bungalow as their first property venture together. Martin is less than impressed with the position of the only bathroom in a three-bed semi in Burton-on-Trent, and Dion gets his thinking cap on when he visits a Staffordshire property with a higgledy-piggledy layout and a concrete jungle of a garden.
