Today, March 13
Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First to arrive today is a musical challenge for the barn's instrument expert, Pete Woods. John Barnes and his daughter Hazel have a very precious cornet that once belonged to John's wife, and Hazel's mum, Kath. Kath started playing the cornet when she was just six years old, and first met John in the Cleethorpes band they both played in as children.
