A fishing trawler heads out to sea with three brothers and their ailing stepmother aboard. When it returns to Shipton Abbott harbour several hours later, only the three fishermen remain. A note found on deck suggests the woman took her own life. As her estranged daughter comes to town to help make funeral arrangements, the simple case grows more complex. Meanwhile, it's the day of the house visit, but it's no plain sailing for Humphrey and Martha.
