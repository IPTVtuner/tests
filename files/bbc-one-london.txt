First in today is Amy, with two very decorative perfume bottles she hopes will entice the dealers to spend. The next would-be seller is Michelle, with a green vase she has loved since the sixties. Will anyone bid high enough to prize the precious possession away from her? Finally, Colin is offering a very curious light fitting that he found in his loft. Both old and unique, will his item start a bidding war?
