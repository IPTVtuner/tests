The ultimate reality game of detection, backstabbing and trust suddenly becomes very real as the first dramatic banishment takes place, sending shockwaves and suspicion throughout the castle. Before the dust settles, the Traitors' commit their second murder. Focus then turns to a high-stakes, high-rewards mission, and as night starts to fall, the Players head back to the Round Table. But will the Faithful get their revenge and catch a Traitor, or will they unwittingly sacrifice one of their own?
