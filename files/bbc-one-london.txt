Although they don't want to move any great distance, the beautiful Berkshire countryside will be a far cry from busy Slough, where today's young couple is moving from. With a baby on the way, they want more space than their current flat provides, and Ginny Buckley is on hand to help them find the right house for their growing family. She also discovers what some of the residents in the region are doing to combat the increasing issue of river pollution.
