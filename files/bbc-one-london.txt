Martin is in Erith, on the outskirts of London, to see a two-bed mid-terrace that has been bought by a former builder. He's also in Derby to visit a three-bed mid-terrace where a novice developer, inspired by the show, is hoping his first solo project goes well. Tommy is in London to see a top-floor flat with a view he's particularly taken by.
