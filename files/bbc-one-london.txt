Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Mei-Mei Heryet is the first to arrive at the barn, with an ornately carved Victorian table in need of attention from antique furniture restorer Will Kirk. Mei-Mei grew up in the west of Ireland, where her father ran a fishing lodge. The table was used to tie fish flies, and Mei-Mei's earliest memories are of sitting at the table helping her father.
