Although Nicki Chapman's buyers are currently renting in a Surrey town, they've spent the last 25 years living and working in America. They now want to find their new, forever home in the Aberdeenshire countryside. Nicki also visits a local farm which grows over 20 varieties of crops, selling many of them in a large, state-of-the-art vending machine.
