Hazel Irvine guides you through what promises to be a medal-laden day nine in the French capital, with champions set to be crowned in artistic gymnastics, golf, tennis and cycling. There are three gold medals on offer in artistic gymnastics, with Team GB's reigning world champion Jake Jarman seeking to spring his way onto the Olympic podium in the men's vault final. There could also be British interest in the men's rings final, with Courtney Tulloch the most likely to make an impact.
