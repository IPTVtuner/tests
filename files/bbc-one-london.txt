Ben and Kate discover the importance of the keepers understanding every aspect of the lives of their animals, and in tiger territory, that's more vital than ever. For the past few weeks, they have noticed female Amur tiger Yana is acting strangely. She's not lying on her stomach, and she is increasingly inactive. This could be a worrying sign if they hadn't observed her mating with male tiger Red. With cautious anticipation the team are starting to believe that Yana could be pregnant.
