Mark Chapman introduces highlights of the day's two Premier League matches, including Liverpool's clash with improving Chelsea at Anfield. It is a fixture that has provided huge drama over the years, and in which Liverpool have held the upper hand of late. After seven successive draws in all competitions, the Reds won 4-1 at Anfield last season and followed that up with a 1-0 victory in the League Cup final at Wembley. The day's other game sees champions Manchester City travel to Molineux.
