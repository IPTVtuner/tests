Mark Chapman hosts live coverage as Preston North End, the only Football League side left in this season's FA Cup, contest their first quarter-final since 1966, taking on Aston Villa. North End have lifted the famous trophy twice and been runners-up on a further five occasions, most recently in 1964. The Championship club have beaten Charlton, Wycombe and Burnley to get to this stage, so this will be their first test against top-flight opposition.
