Jungles and rainforests are home to 80 per cent of all species on earth, but they cover just 2 per cent of our planet's surface. To win the mating game here, you need to be able to stand out from the crowd. For some it's all about putting on a show, whereas others must fight for their chance of victory. And for a few creatures, working together is the key. Chimpanzees are notorious for their brutality and violence, and for most this is the simplest way to secure a mate. Dominant males can fight off rivals and impress the ladies. But for one younger male, forging long-lasting relationships through care and attention has proved to be an incredibly fruitful method of currying favour with the female chimps. The abundance of food in the jungle means that many species can focus much of their attention on breeding. In Papua New Guinea, a MacGregor's bowerbird has spent his life collecting sounds and building a castle, all in the hope of attracting a partner.
