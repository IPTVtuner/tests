Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. The first item to arrive is a double challenge for metal man Dominic Chinea and upholstery expert Sonnaz Nooranvary. Father and daughter Joe and Sophie Davies have a piece of their family trade's history that they are hoping to revive to be used again. Joe's father, Bill, opened a barber's shop in 1949, and both Joe and Sophie have followed in his footsteps. One of the last remaining mementos of the original shop is a 1960s chrome and vinyl barber's chair, which Sophie dreams of having as the centre piece of her own shop. Dom must work out how to repair the hydraulic mechanism, while Sonnaz has to replace and reupholster the ripped and faded vinyl seat covering. Next through the barn doors is Sima Oskoui, with an unusual instrument that will test the skills of Julyan Wallis.
