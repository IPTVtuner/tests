A third-floor flat in Bournemouth with a balcony, a house on a corner plot in Maidstone and a large, five-bedroom, semi-detached Victorian house in Reading are all sold at online auctions. Martin Roberts and Jacqui Jospeh look at the lots and meet the new owners before they start work on renovating their new projects. All three sets of developers lean on the help of friends and family to get the work done, but even so, will any of them manage to create ideal homes on budget?
