Jay Blades and the team rejuvenate three cherished heirlooms that have fallen into disrepair. First to receive an item in need of attention is our master of metal work, Dominic Chinea. Nick Cope has brought in a 1950s rocking duck chair that has been enjoyed by countless children in his family. The cheery-looking duck originally belonged to his aunt, who tragically died as a child. His mother was devastated by the loss of her sister and kept the rocking chair as a reminder of her sibling.
