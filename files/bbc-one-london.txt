Rob Brydon is back in the host's chair for the award-winning comedy panel show, with Lee Mack and David Mitchell returning as the lightning-quick team captains. Each week, a stellar cast of celebrity guests reveal extraordinary stories about themselves. But are they telling the truth, or are they making it all up? Sorting the fact from fiction this time are guests Charlie Brooker, Professor Hannah Fry, Danny Jones and Shaparak Khorsandi.
