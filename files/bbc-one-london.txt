Jay Blades and the team resuscitate three family heirlooms, reviving the memories that they hold. The barn's first arrival is Clint Yallop. He has brought in his grandfather's notebook, which desperately requires the skills of bookbinder Chris Shaw. Clint's grandfather, George Yallop, worked as a pathology technician at the Royal London Hospital in the early 1900s and meticulously documented his research and experiments in notebooks like this.
