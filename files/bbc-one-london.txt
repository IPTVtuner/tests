Today, we find out how the keepers' continued vigilance and dedication to the animals' welfare can alert them when something seems to be wrong. There's another milestone for Hazel, the first southern koala born in Europe. She has to be separated from her mother for a short period. This is to ensure that the keepers earn the baby's trust before she becomes impossible to work with. Without this, the park wouldn't be able to perform their routine and important health checks.
