Martel is in St Helens, Merseyside to see a three bed mid terrace with some pretty ominous signs of damp. She's also in a rural part of West Lothian in Scotland to see a four bed detached house that really has seen better days, but has the potential to be a beautiful family home. Martin is in Launceston in Cornwall where a one bed flat with a wonderful view but a short lease is on offer.
