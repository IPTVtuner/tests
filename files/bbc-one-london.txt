A very special 20th birthday episode! Martin is joined by Changing Rooms legend Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen to look around a three-bedroom terrace just outside Bristol, and of course Laurence falls in love with the avocado bathroom suite! We delve into the archives going all the way back to 2005, where Martin saw a disused former public toilet that was up for sale at auction. Jacqui is in Essex to see a three-bed semi that's crumbling from the outside and letting the street down.
