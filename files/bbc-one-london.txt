Jacqui Joseph scours the recycling centre at Earlswood in Surrey, on the hunt for quality items. Her mission is to save three items, have them transformed or revitalised and try to sell them for a profit. She has her sights on a travel trunk, and there's a 1940s utility cabinet for designer Rupert Blanchard and a dressing table with sentimental value in need of a spruce up from furniture artist Chloe Kempster.
