Telecommunications guru Winston Deavor enlists Elastigirl to fight crime and make the public fall in love with superheroes once again. That leaves Mr Incredible with one of his greatest challenges ever: staying at home and taking care of three rambunctious children. As Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack offer him a new set of headaches, a cyber-criminal named Screenslaver launches his dastardly plan: to hypnotise the world through computer screens.
