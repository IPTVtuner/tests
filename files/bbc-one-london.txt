Alistair Appleton visits former `Escape to the Country' house hunters to find out what happened next with their planned rural moves. First, he meets a couple who were searching for some Scottish solitude when they looked at homes on the Isle of Arran with Jules Hudson in the spring of 2018. Alistair finds that the water now plays a bigger part in their new life than they ever imagined, but in a completely different location.
