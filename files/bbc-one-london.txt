When a man dies in a house fire, it looks like a tragic accident. But two years later, it emerges he had a visitor before the fire. And his card was used to buy a flight to Italy. After all this time, will the airline be able to provide information about the passenger? In another case, police investigating a series of distraction burglaries follow a car to Northern Ireland, where an undercover cop is able to identify their man. And then, they bump into him in an unlikely location.
