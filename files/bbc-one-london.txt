Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First through the barn doors is Gloria Bartlett. She's brought her pride and joy, a Chesterfield armchair, in the hope that upholstery super star Sonnaz Norranvary can return it to mint condition. She borrowed the money to pay for two chairs and a sofa in the 1980s and at the time felt very extravagant.
