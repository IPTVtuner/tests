Gabby Logan presents live coverage from round two of the always enthralling annual rugby championship as Scotland host pre-tournament favourites France at Murrayfield. France were victorious on their most recent Six Nations visit to Edinburgh in 2022, triumphing 36-17 in week two on their way to winning a tenth Grand Slam and an eighteenth title. Scotland, though, have won the three previous home meetings in this tournament, whilst they also defeated France in a Rugby World Cup warm-up match.
