It's the end of this road trip for Irita Marriott and Mark Hill as they pilot their 1960s Triumph Herald towards one last auction. With money in their pockets and a renewed sense of purpose, the competition is heating up. As they hit the shops, Irita decides to throw caution to the wind and buy with her heart rather than her head. However, she's distracted by a trip to a historic farm to find out why music played a key role in spreading the Salvation Army's message over the years.
