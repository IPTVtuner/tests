Nicki Chapman helps an animal-loving house hunter from a town in Oxfordshire who has a generous budget of Â£700,000 to find a new village community in Dorset, ideally close to the coast. Making the most of the seaside locale, Nicki visits a luxury yacht manufacturer to experience how the other half set sail in serious style.
