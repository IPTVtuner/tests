Mark Chapman presents live coverage of the first match in Group E as Romania and Ukraine meet in Munich. This will be Ukraine's first major tournament appearance since the country was invaded by Russia in 2022. Qualification was achieved despite having to play their home games on neutral territory, while squad members who play their club football in Ukraine regularly have their matches interrupted by warnings of air raids.
