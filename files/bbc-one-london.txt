Ginny Buckley is in Suffolk, helping a retired couple from Essex find a new home in a thriving village as close to the county's coast as their Â£475,000 budget will allow. Ginny also visits a farm during asparagus season, but before she gets to sample some freshly picked vegetables, she first has to learn how to harvest them.
