In Royal Wootton Bassett, Nicky, a hardworking single mum of four teenagers, needs Charlie and the Rich brothers to ride to the rescue of her garden. It's got tired turf, an ugly concrete path and no patio or decking to sit out on. But it does have one thing Nicky loves - her gnome collection! Nicky wants the garden to be somewhere fun, practical, social and easy to maintain, where the kids aren't embarrassed to bring friends and the gnomes can be proudly on display.
