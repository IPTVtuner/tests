Mark Chapman presents highlights of the day's two Premier League matches, including title-chasing Liverpool's clash with Tottenham at Anfield. The match is Jurgen Klopp's penultimate home league game in charge of the Reds, and he will be hoping to maintain his record of having never lost a match at Anfield to Spurs. In fact, Tottenham's results at the ground have been poor, with the last of their two Premier League wins there coming back in 2011.
