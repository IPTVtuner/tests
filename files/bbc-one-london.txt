Jules Hudson retraces his steps in the county of Norfolk. Back in 2021, he helped a couple from south east London search for a new Norfolk home to accommodate them, their three children and Grandma too. Jules returns to find out that one of the houses in his initial line up, that they said was everything they didn't want, has now become their perfect escape from the capital. Jules also reconnects with another pair of his house-hunters.
