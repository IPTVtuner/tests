First through the doors is Lucas with a sizeable bird cage he once gifted to his mother - and her canaries. The birds have all flown the nest and their impressive home is now on the market.

Next in is Sharon, hoping to match-make her Italian marriage cloth to the right dealer and raise some funds for an animal rescue charity.
