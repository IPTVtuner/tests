Jacqui is in Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex to look at a two-bedroom maisonette bought by a mother-and-son developing team. Martin is in Coleford, Gloucestershire near the Forest of Dean, to see a flat in real need of renovation. And Dion is just south of Stoke-on-Trent in Barlaston to see a three-bedroom end-of-terrace bought to become a new family home.
