Jules Hudson is on home ground in the Welsh Borders as he showcases some tempting houses to a retired couple who have a whopping Â£1 million to spend. Along with a characterful property, they're after somewhere with holiday-let potential or space for a glamping business. Jules is also in his element when he meets experts in traditional construction methods who are keeping heritage building skills alive.
