Stepping into the beautiful gardens in Oxfordshire today are Jaycee from West Sussex and Tristan from Perthshire, both hoping to turn their love for their crafts into successful businesses. Ex-HR worker Jaycee made the brave decision to give up the day job to concentrate full time on her upcycling business and hopes that Dom and his team of mentors can help. Mentor Zoe is worried that Jaycee is focusing on the wrong items and is keen for her to rethink her way forward.
