The Rev Kate Bottley celebrates the centenary of Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral and meets Christians whose faith has been shaped by this remarkable building. Consecrated in 1924, Liverpool Cathedral stands today as the largest cathedral in the UK and a beacon of hope overlooking Merseyside. Veteran tour guide Alan shows Kate around. He was a schoolchild during the cathedral's construction and has been volunteering there for over 30 years.
