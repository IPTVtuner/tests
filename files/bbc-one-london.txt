Stacey and her gang challenge the Viney family to sort their lives out by decluttering in just seven days. Not only did grandma of six Sue fill her house up with her late mum's belongings, she also acquired the contents of a recently closed gift shop. Daughters Nicki and Donna want to spend more time at the house with their kids, but all the clutter means there isn't any space.
