Live coverage of the final set of games from Group E as Ukraine face Belgium in Stuttgart, with places in the round of 16 up for grabs. Ukraine's tally of three points was enough for them to qualify as one of the best third-placed teams in 2021. That brought them to a first-ever European Championship knockout stage, where a 2-1 extra-time victory against Sweden set up a quarter-final clash with England, which they lost 4-0 against the eventual finalists.
