Ben, Kate and the keepers are pulling out all the stops to deliver festive treats in time for the big day. The whole park is mobilised for one of the biggest animal enrichments on record. The keepers have arranged for tons of sand to be delivered to the safari drive-through for the zebras, giraffe and ostrich to play in. The keepers anticipate they'll love rolling in their treat, but as is so often the case with toys at Christmas, should they have kept the receipt?
