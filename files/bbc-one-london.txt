Martin is in the Cornish village of Blackwater to see a three-bed bungalow with an exterior that reminds him of a Battenberg cake! Tommy heads to Wandsworth in south London to visit a large period property split into three separate flats, with an eyewatering guide price of over Â£1 million. Martel takes a trip to Bilston in the West Midlands, where a three-bed semi with a rather large driveway catches her eye.
