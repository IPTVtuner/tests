Stacey Solomon returns for a Crafty Christmas special, where friends and family join her to create a new batch of ingenious homemade gifts and decorations that she hopes will bring festive joy without blowing the budget. This year, Stacey will be throwing a special Christmas party at her Grandma Gwen's residential home to give all the residents and their amazing carers a magical evening to remember.
