Jonnie Irwin is with a young couple wanting to escape London to build a new life in the Surrey countryside. They're hoping that their great Â£900,000 budget finds them a large home for their growing family that's close to good schools, with convenient links to the capital. Jonnie also gets to grips with a bat when he joins a local baseball team to try out America's national pastime, which can trace its roots back to the county.
