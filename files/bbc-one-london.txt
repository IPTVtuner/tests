The Mirror and the Light opens in the heartbeat after Anne Boleyn's death, as the young queen's blood is sluiced from the scaffold and Thomas Cromwell picks his way across the wreckage to take up his position as principal councillor to an unpredictable king. Despite his lowly beginnings in a Putney blacksmith's forge, Cromwell has made a reputation for himself as one of England's most formidable politicians.
