Jay Blades and the team rejuvenate three cherished heirlooms, sparking precious memories of the past. First to arrive is Helen Giltrow, with a miniature silver kettle. She's hoping that silversmith Brenton West can get it singing again. The tiny treasure was made by Helen's great-grandfather, who was a tinsmith by trade, and according to her family, it was crafted from a silver shilling. The kettle was passed down to Helen's mum, who displayed it proudly in a cabinet.
