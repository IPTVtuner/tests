Adrian and Jenny have managed to clear their garden in Pershore, but they are uninspired by the moonscape they've been left with. There is nothing left in this garden but a shed and a gas tank, this really is a garden that needs to be rescued! Desperate for some inspiration, they've asked the team to create a woodland garden with Â£5,000, but with a fun, gothic twist to satisfy Jenny's darker side.
