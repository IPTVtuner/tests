Lesley longs for a garden to spend time with her two children and four grandchildren, but her bizarrely shaped plot has her flummoxed.

Lee and Chris take up the challenge and offer designs reminiscent of Lesley's favourite Greek holidays. It's not long before the team begin to struggle with the odd angles in the garden.
