Clive loves Venice, but on this trip, he wants to learn what it's like to be a local, outnumbered by tourists by over 200 to 1. He hitches a lift with a rare female gondolier and learns the tough craft of steering with one oar, gets a lesson in glass-blowing from his new friend Count Gibi, and finds out why Italian vegetables taste so great as he picks peppers on a farm in the Venetian lagoon.
