The devoted owners of no fewer than six Irish wolfhounds are in desperate need of more space for them and those countless muddy paws, so have set their sights on Suffolk for a bit more elbow room. Briony May Williams is there to guide them as they tour a selection of beautiful homes. Briony also gets to mess about on a stunning million pound, bespoke wooden yacht, a sister vessel to the ones featured in James Bond.
