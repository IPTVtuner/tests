Sonali Shah meets up with a couple who bought one of the houses presented to them on a 2019 `Escape to the Country' property hunt in Bedfordshire. A year on she finds out how they have embraced chic, country-cottage d√©cor and discovers whether they have managed to recreate their all-important back-garden pub. Sonali then makes her way to the land of apple orchards with a couple who have put down roots together in the Herefordshire countryside after renovating a stunning property from the 1700s.
