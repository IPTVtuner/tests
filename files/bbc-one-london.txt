North Africa, 100 million years ago. A Spinosaurus father must embark on a dangerous voyage to feed his babies. To reach the destination, he must lead his young family across one of the deadliest environments in earth's history: a land crawling with ferocious predators. At the end of their journey, an extraordinary feast awaits - if he can run the gauntlet without his babies becoming someone else's meal.
