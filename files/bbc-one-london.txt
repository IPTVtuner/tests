It's the fourth leg of a week-long road trip with glass champion Mark Hill and silver magnet Margie Cooper. They're heading straight for the Scottish border in a 1980 MGB Roadster, each with Â£200 to splurge on antiques between the towns of Berwick-upon-Tweed and Hawick. Margie steps out her comfort zone with her first ever alabaster purchase and a parrot that is about to make the long journey home.
