In true Escape to the Country style, today's couple (both former international rugby players) want to leave London in search of a rural idyll in Dorset, and Alistair Appleton is the man to help them on their way. Aside from property, Alistair learns about the health benefits of watercress at a farm that specialises in growing this delicious and nutritious crop.
