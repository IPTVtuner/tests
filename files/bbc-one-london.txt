Martel tries to remain stable, despite there being no horses, as she looks around a Cumbrian house set on three acres of land. Jacqui is investigating a former pub, but last orders were served there a long time ago. Tommy is in Suffolk, where a two-bedroom mid-terrace has him cooing over the garden. Just like old times, eh Tommy!
