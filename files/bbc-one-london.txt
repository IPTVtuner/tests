A young couple buy their first house together and turn it into a lovely home in Macclesfield, two brothers buy an unusual set of disused buildings from the 1950s in Codnor, and another couple hope to make some money by renovating a house in Rainworth. All three buildings were sold at auction, and Martin and Dion talk to the new owners before work gets underway.
