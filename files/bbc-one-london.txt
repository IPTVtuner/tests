Hosted by Joel Dommett, the ultimate physical and psychological game races to a climax as the remaining five players fight to outwit, outplay and outlast their rivals to win Â£100,000 and the title of Sole Survivor. With just four days left in the game, a dilemma at the outpost provides some motivation for the final five as they make some difficult emotional decisions about one another.
