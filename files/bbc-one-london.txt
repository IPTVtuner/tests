A host of swimming's global stars converge on the pool for another night of world-class action, with four gold medals to be decided in Paris. The session begins with the women's 200m butterfly final, where Canada's 17-year-old sensation Summer McIntosh is expected to take the title. Team GB's Luke Greenbank will be desperate to reach the podium again in the men's 200m backstroke after his bronze in Tokyo, while the evening concludes with the women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
