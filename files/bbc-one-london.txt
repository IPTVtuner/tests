Ryan and Eve would love to host family gatherings in their garden, but sadly in its current state, they can't. The garden is nothing but a barren, brownfield wasteland, and they are at a loss as to what to do with it. Drawing inspiration from their honeymoon in California, where they fell in love with the plants, the design concepts and structures of Balboa Park and the Palace of Fine Arts, they want a garden that reminds them of those happy times.
