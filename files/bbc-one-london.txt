Pop superstar, H from Steps - aka Ian Watkins - along with his partner Tom, put property expert Denise Nurse through her paces as she attempts to find them the perfect family home in the beautiful South Wales countryside where H was born and raised. Denise presents a selection of homes fit for an international musical icon and the couple teaches her some of the local lingo, whilst they all try their hands at sheep herding and spill the tea on a visit to a Welsh tea plantation.
