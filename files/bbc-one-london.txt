Kate Humble and Ben Fogle return to Longleat Safari Park for a spectacular, sun-drenched summer series, following the remarkable lives of the exotic animals and the keepers committed to help them. In this episode, a cowardly lion is in danger of being attacked by her fellow lioness. Beryl's solitary behaviour is putting her in peril, as an unconfident member of the pride can be rejected.
