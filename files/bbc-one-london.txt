Jay Blades and the team lovingly resuscitate four treasured family heirlooms and the memories they hold. First into the barn are siblings Marc Maderson and Melanie Henry, with a 50-year-old childhood toy. They're hoping bookbinder Chris Shaw will be able to make their tattered and torn paper kite flight-worthy once again. The kite was made by Marc's stepfather and Melanie's father Roddy, who died six years ago.
