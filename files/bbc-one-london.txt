Sarah Moore is at Witley recycling centre in Surrey, hoping to uncover three lucrative items amongst the trash-filled boots bound for the skips. She enlists the help of designer Ayo Daramola-Martin to find an innovative new use for a 200-year-old stained-glass window, while upholsterer Simion Hawtin-Smith hopes to rejuvenate some tired rattan furniture. For her own project, Sarah sets herself the challenge of turning some handmade wooden boxes into cold, hard cash.
