Today's Bargain Hunt comes from Detling in Kent, where Natasha Raskin Sharp is leading proceedings. Caroline Hawley and Raj Bisram give the teams a helping hand as they go in search of profit-making finds to sell at auction. Natasha takes time out with a cup of tea as she checks out Teapot Island, which houses a collection of more than 8,000 novelty teapots, and discovers how they became a kitchen fashion accessory.
