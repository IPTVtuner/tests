Ginny Buckley is in the Shropshire countryside with a sociable couple who have Â£425,000 to invest in a character home that gives them space for entertaining and their beloved jukebox. Away from the house search, Ginny visits The Royal Air Force Museum Cosford and meets the conservation team reconstructing a rare Hampden bomber which played an important role in the skies during the Second World War.
