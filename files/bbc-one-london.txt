First into the barn is Hannah Smart, with a moss-covered garden gate which is essentially just a pile of sticks. It comes from the cottage Hannah has just bought which is the former home of Roald Dahl's mother. When Dahl returned from fighting in the Second World War, he lived at the cottage with his mother, and the gate is even referenced in his autobiography when he describes the moment he came home from the war.
