England, 1954. Young and ambitious Luke Fitzwilliam arrives from Nigeria with the promise of a job in Whitehall. On the train to London, he meets the elderly Miss Pinkerton, who confides in him that there is a killer on the loose in her quiet village of Wychwood-Under-Ashe. When Miss Pinkerton is struck down on her way to Scotland Yard, leaving the spoils of a lucrative Derby win in Fitzwilliam's hands, he finds himself in a moral predicament.
