Nigel Havers welcomes sellers of collectables and curiosities to the Bidding Room's home in Edinburgh, where they ply their wares to five dealers. First through the doors of the Bidding Room is Carol with a collection she hopes will play to the dealers' inner child. Her wind-up tin-plate toys were bought by her mother in Switzerland and have entertained Carol's sons for years, but the time has come to move the toys on.
