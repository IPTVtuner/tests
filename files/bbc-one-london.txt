Nicki Chapman reconnects with past escapees in the Cotswolds and Shropshire. It was nearly love at first sight for a couple from Scotland, who, in 2020, wanted Nicki's help with finding them their first house together in the Cotswolds. Nicki succeeded and is given a warm welcome when she drops in to see how they've put their own stamp on their new cottage. Nicki then heads to Shropshire where she reunites with an entrepreneurial couple who had ambitions of opening a cookery school.
