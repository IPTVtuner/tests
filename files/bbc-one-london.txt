John Craven and Margherita Taylor explore Woodoaks Farm in Hertfordshire, where efforts are under way to restore nature's balance and reconnect people with farming. John discovers the rural heritage of the farm, which was donated to the Soil Association in 2020, and learns about the vision for its future. He also meets a historian who has unearthed the lost diary of a local farmer, written over 150 years ago, and hears about the wisdom within its pages that still holds true for farming today.
