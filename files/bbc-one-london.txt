With a couple from Cambridgeshire, Jules Hudson enjoys a packed few days in west Wales of skimming stones, learning Welsh and meeting a chef from France, who loves to whip up tasty dishes using locally made mead. Jules even has time to help the couple look for a three-bedroom home with a holiday let or annexe, an acre of land and all for a budget of Â£425,000.
