Gary Lineker presents live coverage of the FA Cup quarter-final between holders Manchester City and Newcastle United, with a place in one of the two Wembley semi-finals just 90 minutes away. Pep Guardiola's City side blazed into the last eight with a thumping 6-2 victory at Luton, with goal machine Erling Haaland scoring a remarkable five times. Unsurprisingly, they are favourites to retain the trophy they claimed by beating rivals Manchester United last season.
