Gary Lineker presents highlights from the day's seven Premier League matches, which include newly promoted Ipswich Town making the trip to champions Manchester City. Kieran McKenna's side have enjoyed successive promotions in the last two seasons, finishing runners-up in the Championship in 2023/24 on 96 points, but they face a tough task here against a City team who made history in May when they became the first men's team ever to win four top-flight titles in a row.
