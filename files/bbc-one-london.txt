The barn welcomes a former professional goalkeeper who's brought in a football programme from a momentous match he played in 1970. Peter Grotier was a member of the West Ham team that flew out to New York to play an exhibition game against Santos just after Brazil had won the World Cup. Not only was Peter's hero Sir Bobby Moore in his squad, but they were playing against his other hero, the great goalscorer Pele. Peter didn't even mind when he let in two goals!
