It's Thursday and the start of a new 12-hour shift for the North West Ambulance Service, and junior doctors across the NHS are on strike. With hundreds of hospital appointments and non-urgent operations cancelled, there is nervous anticipation in the ambulance control centre over what the shift might bring. The ambulance service can decide to prioritise certain emergencies, so when an urgent 999 call is received for an accident on a busy road, senior paramedic Aiden is immediately dispatched.
