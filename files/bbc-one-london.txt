We're bouncing along on a brand new road trip from Yorkshire to Edinburgh with never-before-seen pairing Margie Cooper and Mark Hill. Their chariot is a bright yellow 1980 MGB Roadster, and they each have Â£200 to spend on each leg of the trip. The winner will be the expert that wins the most auctions in our 'best-of-five' competition. The first leg of the trip takes our duo across the sights of South Yorkshire.
