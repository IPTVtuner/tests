Mark Chapman presents highlights from today's two Premier League matches, featuring the north London derby between arch-rivals Tottenham and Arsenal. In this fixture in the 2023-24 season, Arsenal roared into a 3-0 half-time lead and then withstood a Tottenham fightback to secure consecutive top-flight wins at the home of their neighbours for the first time since September 1988.
