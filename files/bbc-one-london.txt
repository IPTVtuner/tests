Gloria Hunniford, Julia Somerville and Angela Rippon meet the families who paid tens of thousands of pounds for dream home extensions - only to be left with dangerously bad work that could cost much more to put right. The team asks whether a licensing scheme for all builders could stop the cowboys once and for all. Also, the couple who chose the self-proclaimed number one company in the business to have their state-of-the-art new heating system installed but now bitterly regret it.
