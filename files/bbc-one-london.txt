Highlights from nine midweek Premier League matches, including the Merseyside derby between Liverpool and Everton and Manchester City's game with Leicester. Runaway leaders Liverpool will hope to take another step towards their second Premier League title. But neighbours Everton, who scored an injury-time equaliser to draw 2-2 in February's reverse fixture, will be keen to delay any celebrations for as long as possible.
