The Northamptonshire village of Naseby is the setting for this high-energy episode. Two teams browse the stalls at an antiques fair to buy three items to sell at auction. On the red team are in-laws Dawn and Fariha with their expert Thomas Forrester. They plan to 'leave the opposition feeling blue'. They take on long-time friends Sarah and Helen, guided by Irita Marriott.
