Hannah and Christie are a couple whose boxy 42-square-metre garden doesn't reflect their fun-loving lifestyle. Chris is a DJ, and Hannah plays the sax, and the feel of a music festival would be a great theme for the team to include. Charlie and Lee get their raving shoes on to win the couple over. The winning design may have Ibiza vibes, but the team have proper wet, north western weather to tackle on the build.
