Gary Lineker introduces highlights from all of the day's Premier League matches, including Manchester City's visit to Aston Villa and the London derby between Arsenal and Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Brentford, who have been involved in plenty of exciting matches this season, hosted Nottingham Forest, who have so far exceeded expectations in this campaign, thanks to the prolific scoring of Chris Wood. Today's other two games see Brighton travelling to West Ham and Ipswich hosting Newcastle.
