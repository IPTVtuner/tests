When Nicki Chapman accompanied a retired teacher on a property-seeking mission in North Yorkshire, back in the autumn of 2021, neither of them could have imagined where the journey would ultimately lead. Picking up the baton, Denise Nurse explores the metamorphosis of this resilient and intrepid escapee and the beautiful home she's created. In another transformative tale, Denise acquaints herself with a couple who had their hearts set on some Cotswolds character.
