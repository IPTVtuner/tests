Chloe and Peter are a young couple who have just moved to Godalming in Surrey with their dog. However, their new garden is a neglected, overgrown mess that has a strict tree preservation order on four of the trees. The couple envision a blend of arts and crafts and French formality in their new garden - how will the designers, Charlie and Chris, interpret these very different, almost conflicting ideas in their pitches? With a budget of Â£6,000.
