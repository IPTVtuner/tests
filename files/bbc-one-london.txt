Nigel Havers welcomes sellers of collectibles and curiosities to the Bidding Room's home in Edinburgh, where they ply their wares to five dealers. The first, hopeful seller is Mike, with a vintage poster from 1920s Paris. Next in is Joe, with his team of boys, Fabio and Gino. They've brought a late 20th-century football table. Third into Edinburgh HQ are Kate and Dan, with an item that's more than what it seems.
