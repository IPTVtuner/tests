Julie and Phillip are like ships that pass in the night. Julie works on shifts in an emergency unit, so the couple would like a garden to spend more time in when they are together. They are surrounded by brick walls and would like a wildlife-focused space with Â£3,000 to spend. The first challenge is to make the budget go as far as possible, and so the team source patio slabs that are identical to what the couple have to give them a bigger social space.
