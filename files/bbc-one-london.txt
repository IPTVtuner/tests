The UK was a different country the last time a monarch was crowned. Now, seventy years on, Charles III has to show what sort of a monarch he will be for a 21st-century Britain. With exclusive access to the King and Queen Camilla, this historic film follows them throughout the first year of their reign, including unprecedented behind-the-scenes access to preparations for the Coronation, as well as the day itself.
