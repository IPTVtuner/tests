Esme Young and Patrick Grant put four celebrities' sewing skills to the test. Host Sara Pascoe is joined by Strictly Come Dancing's Johannes Radebe, EastEnders actor Natalie Cassidy, podcaster Rosie Ramsey and TV personality Penny Lancaster as they put their twist on a pattern for a Christmas apron. They then turn a sack full of children's hand-me-downs into a novelty outfit for a baby. Finally, they create pop star-inspired fancy dress perfect for bringing in the New Year.
