Charlotte Smith and Matt Baker head to Elan Valley, nestled in the heart of the Cambrian Mountains, where the Welsh natural world is getting ready for the onset of winter. The valley is a patchwork of habitats including Celtic rainforests, open moorland and raging rivers all dominated by huge dams. These dams have changed the landscape forever, and Charlotte finds out how the rivers of Elan Valley have recently welcomed back migrating salmon.
