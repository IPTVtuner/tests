Nigel Havers welcomes sellers of collectables and curiosities to the Bidding Room's new home in Edinburgh, where they ply their wares to five dealers. Before facing the discerning dealers, each eager seller meets Nigel and auctioneer Simon Bower to learn the unique characteristics and history of their pieces, plus that all-important valuation, so that when they enter the Bidding Room, they're armed with all the information they need to haggle the best possible price from the dealers.
