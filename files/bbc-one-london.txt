Our couples return to the Strictly ballroom as the competition reaches its climatic final weeks. They'll each perform another routine before taking on a brand new challenge, the first ever samba-thon. As the judges eliminate them one by one, who will volta their way to victory? Points from both rounds of dancing will be combined before you at home get the chance to save your favourites.
