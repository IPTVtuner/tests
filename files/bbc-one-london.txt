Alistair Appleton is back to meet some accomplished athletes following their successful house-hunting challenges in the countryside. A year since two ex-rugby internationals were bowled over by one of Alistair's property offerings in Dorset, he returns to meet some of the extended family and is treated to a home-cooked feast.
