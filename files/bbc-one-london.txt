Live coverage from Derbyshire as sixth-tier minnows Alfreton Town seek to reach the FA Cup third round for the first time in their history with a giant-killing victory over Walsall. Alfreton, whose most recent second-round tie came 11 years ago, overcame fellow non-league side Worthing in the competition in November, with Nathan Newall setting them on their way with a spectacular first goal for the club.
