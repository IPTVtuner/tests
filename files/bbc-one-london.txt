Last season's corresponding fixture ended in defeat for Aston Villa after a late header from Scott McTominay gave United the double over the Birmingham side. The day's other games see Chelsea host Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur's visit to Brighton. Mark and his guests will also discuss the goals and talking points from Saturday's seven games.
