The team repair a dictaphone which contains a recording unheard for 80 years, whilst a barber set and Hungarian fruit bowl are also on the jobs list. Arriving first is Sebastian from Edinburgh, who brought with him an item that once belonged to his godfather in the 1930s. The tabletop dictaphone is a remarkable piece of equipment that allowed Sebastian's godfather, author William Gerhardie, to dictate his writing to a secretary, who would type the words for print.
