This week, Alan welcomes three new teams to take on the picture challenge: co-parents Sas and David from Haywards Heath, flatmates George and Joe from Manchester and father-son duo Sanjay and Kavi from east London. They'll face each other across four frantic rounds against the clock - including the brand new Picture Twist and buzzer rounds - with one team making it to the final Super Slam. Will they know their Idris Elba from their peach melba and take home the Â£10,000 jackpot?
