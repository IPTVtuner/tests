Nigel Havers welcomes three more sellers to the Bidding Room, where they try to sell items to professional dealers who are on the lookout for interesting pieces, with help from expert Simon Bower. First through the doors is Kathy with a much-loved retro Battling Tops board game that has been the source of fun for many a family games night. Will the dealers be competing to win this one, or will it be game over for Kathy? Becky is selling a set of convertible shelves on behalf of her boss.
