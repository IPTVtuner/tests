Alistair Appleton border-hops between Herefordshire and its neighbouring counties today as he helps a buyer from Guernsey to find her perfect party property in the countryside for a budget of Â£500,000. Whilst in the area, Alistair also pays a home visit to fellow Escape to the Country presenter Jules Hudson, where they reminisce about their time on the show and ponder what the future holds for the countryside housing market.
