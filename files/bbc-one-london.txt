A couple from the Surrey town of Epsom enjoy the spectacular landscape in Argyll and Bute as Nicki Chapman provides them with some expert property advice. For their budget of Â£600,000 they want a house with views that just keep on giving. Nicki also takes to the water on Loch Lomond, meeting a family who have owned and lived on an island for 70 years.
