Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First to arrive at the barn are Steve and Paula Prentice. They're hoping bike expert Tim Gunn will be as handy with one wheel as he is with two. The pair come from a family of variety performers, with both their paternal grandparents and their mum and dad getting in on the act.
