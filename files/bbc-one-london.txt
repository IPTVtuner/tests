Sean and Francesca, both dedicated junior doctors with hectic schedules, are longing for a peaceful oasis to unwind in after their demanding shifts. Their dream garden is inspired by a journey to New Zealand. They would like to bring some of the NZ vibe to their new garden, creating a serene relaxation area incorporating ferns, grasses and raised beds, all brought together with a muted colour scheme.
