A couple from Brighton have a budget of £400,000 to buy their first home together and want a complete change of scenery. They've set their sights on the beautiful countryside of Fife, where Briony May Williams is on hand to help them spend their property pounds. Briony also meets a farmer rearing a herd of buffalo, then samples some Scottish mozzarella cheese produced from their milk.
