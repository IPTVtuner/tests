John Craven revisits the Gloucestershire village of Hillesley 50 years after he first reported on the local newspaper. He meets Hollywood screenwriter William Nicholson, who cut his teeth on the paper, catches up with today's editor, meets three generations of farmers and pops into the pub that was saved by the community to discover what's at the heart of village life. And he delves into the `Countryfile' archives for some of his favourite autumn moments across the years.
