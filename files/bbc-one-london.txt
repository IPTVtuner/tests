Adrian Chiles visits Martin and Shirlie Kemp to talk about what Christmas means to them. The pair share childhood memories, discuss their fame with Spandau Ballet and Wham and share moments of their life together at Christmas as a family. They tell Adrian about receiving hampers from George Michael, their first meeting when Martin wore more make-up than Shirley and how they've coped with life's ups and downs. Adrian also helps them decorate their personal Christmas grotto.
