The heavyweight hits and high-octane action of rugby league's oldest cup competition continue as reigning Super League champions Wigan take on 2023 finalists Hull KR. Wigan have been in dominant form under head coach Matt Peet, winning the Challenge Cup for a record-extending twentieth time in 2022 before following up by winning both the League Leaders' Shield and Grand Final last season. Hull KR reached last season's showpiece at Wembley before missing out in heartbreaking fashion.
