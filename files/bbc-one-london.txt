The shoe is on the other foot for Sonali Shah today as she is invited into the homes of two sets of house hunters who are now proud Norfolk residents. She meets a pair of former emergency workers who had set their sights on Norfolk back in 2017 with the hope of creating a more relaxed lifestyle for their family.
