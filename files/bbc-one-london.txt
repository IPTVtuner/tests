Gary Lineker presents live coverage as hosts Germany take on Hungary as the Euro 2024 group stage enters the second round of matches. The two nations met in the final round of group games three years ago, with Germany midfielder Leon Goretzka's late equaliser ensuring his side reached the last 16, leaving Hungary - who would themselves have qualified with a win - consigned to fourth place in Group F. Germany are attempting to win this tournament for a record fourth time.
