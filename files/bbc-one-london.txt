Charlie and Lee are in Crawley to convert Lamar and Nadine's overgrown, weed-filled, south-facing garden into a tropical social garden. They would love the garden to draw on their combined Jamaican and Myanmar heritage, as well as Sri Lanka, so it's an eclectic mix of semi-tropical planting, socialising spaces and a central cooking area where all the action would take place. Can the team achieve all of this on a Â£5,000 budget?
