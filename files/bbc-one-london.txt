Alistair Appleton guides a pair of budding entrepreneurs who want to escape to the Cotswolds. They have a generous Â£900,000 to play with, but the property must have the potential to develop a boutique country holiday let. Elsewhere, Alistair has an exhilarating spell at the University of Bath when he launches himself on to the UK's only bobsleigh and skeleton push-start track.
