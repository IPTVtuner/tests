The Three Rivers Race, Europe's toughest inland sailing competition, takes place each year on the Norfolk Broads. Over 100 competitors have to navigate 50 miles of the Bure, Ant and Thurne rivers with the task of completing this test of boatmanship, stamina and skill within the 24-hour time limit. Joe Crowley joins the teams at the Horning Sailing Club as they get ready for the start.
