Saddling up on the room's starting line is Sandy, with a rustic relic that's been entertaining her family for generations. The vintage rocking horse, bought when Sandy was just a child, is now in danger of being put out to pasture, i e the skip, unless one of The Dealers can offer a respite with some suitable bids? Next to roll through the doors is Jonathan. He's ready to get the dealers firing on all cylinders with a motorbike that's been unused for the best part of a year.
