Today, the team fix a 100-year-old handwritten Qur'an passed down four generations of women, and a fun-loving nonagenarian prepares to take his family's old scooter for a spin. First into the barn is Farah with a family treasure that's been passed down four generations of women. Her family's Qur'an was made in Kashmir around 1910 and its 600 pages were ornately handwritten from memory.
