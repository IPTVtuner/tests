Sammi Kinghorn and Sean Fletcher explore the natural riches and hidden treasures of Wanlockhead - the highest village in Scotland. Way up in the lofty hills of Dumfries and Galloway, Sean learns how Wanlockhead's fortunes were founded on the mineral content of the land and tries his hand at gold panning in a local waterway. He also turns his eyes to the skies, monitoring populations of golden eagles and building an eyrie for these majestic birds with a local school.
