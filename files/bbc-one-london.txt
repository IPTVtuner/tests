Another seismic showdown between the two oldest rivals in international rugby is anticipated as Scotland seek a fourth win in a row against England for the first time since 1972. The Scots claimed a third successive Calcutta Cup victory in 2023 as England let slip a 20-12 lead at Twickenham in Steve Borthwick's first game in charge. That followed on from Finn Russell's late winning penalty at Murrayfield in 2022 and a first Scotland triumph at Twickenham for 38 years in 2021.
