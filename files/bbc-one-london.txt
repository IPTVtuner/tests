Barbara Windsor traces her maternal grandfather to the east London docks and finds that his mother was a matchgirl at the Bryant and May factory. Barbara's father's family has generations of Cockneys, mostly labourers or costermongers and barrow boys. She discovers that her mother's ancestors were Irish, leaving Cork after the potato famine, and that she's related to the artist Constable.
