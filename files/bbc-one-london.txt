Dion is in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, to see a sizeable three-bed end terrace. The potential to extend or even build another property gets him excited. We revisit an old bank in Hyde, Greater Manchester, that Martin first saw back in June 2018. Tommy is in Bridlington, Yorkshire, to see a two-bed, purpose-built flat and maybe grab some fish and chips at the same time.
