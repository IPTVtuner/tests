We're celebrating 20 years of Homes Under the Hammer with a trip to the capital! Martel shows much loved broadcaster Alex Jones around a rather cramped flat in Shepherds Bush. Martin's exploring the archives with a Chelsea pad that cost an eye-watering amount even 10 years ago. Dion visits a Manchester property, where a familiar face is looking to spruce it up with the help of his family.
