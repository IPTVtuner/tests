Today, the team fix a deeply significant garden ornament for a recently bereaved grandfather and an unusual pair of wooden sandals from Punjab dating back to the 1800s. First into the barn is Claude, joined by daughter Kesi, with a powerful reminder of his political past for the attention of paper conservator Angelina Bakalarou. Claude unravels a tattered and torn velvet poster of a black panther, which he bought from a street vendor back in 1987.
