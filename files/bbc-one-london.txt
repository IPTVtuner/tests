Confronted with a contraption that has clearly seen better days, a daunted Dominic Chinea is taking on the barn's first assignment. All the way from Scotland, brothers Lewis and Ross have wheeled in their family's mobile ice cream trailer. Keen to share the inside scoop on the family business, they reveal that they've been serving up gelato in St Andrews, Fife since 1908 when their great-great-grandfather came over from Italy and started selling the yummy stuff from a shop in the centre of town.
