When smouldering human remains are found in a field in Hertfordshire, a policeman's hunch and a diligent expert witness help catch the killers. Not every expert witness starts their career expecting to use their specialist knowledge to crack serious crime. The expert witness in this case began her working life recording pollen samples on archeological digs. But she then found herself central to an investigation into a brutal murder committed by a gang of criminals. With constant advances in science, the evidence expert witnesses provide is increasingly important in the pursuit of justice. But finding such evidence is never easy. It takes time, patience and a calm head. Some of the toughest cases for an expert witness involve proving responsibility in major traffic collisions. The chaos created during a high speed crash can make finding reliable DNA, fingerprints or fibres impossible.
