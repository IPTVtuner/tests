After Carmel catches and reprimands Barry for creeping into bed during the early hours from god knows where, Barry decides it is finally time to ask for a divorce so he can set up a new life with his best friend and lifelong lover - albeit discreetly. However, Barry's plan to tell Carmel after she returns from church the next morning is scuppered when she brings home her gang of Christian cronies for Sunday lunch.
