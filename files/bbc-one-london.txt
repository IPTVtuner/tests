Rock 'n' roll legend Liam Gallagher returns to Reading Festival for a very special headline performance marking the 30th anniversary of Oasis's seminal debut album Definitely Maybe, almost to the day of its release. The Mancunian icon last headlined the festival solo in 2021, having previously performed with his bands Oasis and Beady Eye.
