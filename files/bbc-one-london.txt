Jacqui and Tommy are in Suffolk, Nottinghamshire and Kent, looking at two homes and a piece of land, all bought by developers at online auctions. Two sets of developers are new to the world of buying and selling houses. One newbie is very ambitious, jumping in at the deep end, buying a piece of land in Old Basford in Nottingham with dreams of building a substantial family home.
