The roadshow comes from the Jetty Museum on the shores of Lake Windermere in the Lake District, where finds include some rare Dinky Toys and a unique piece of footballing history. Fiona hears the heartbreaking story of the Windermere children, orphans rescued from Nazi concentration camps at the end of the Second World and given the chance to rebuild their lives on the shores of this tranquil lake.
