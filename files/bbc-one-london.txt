The park's Amur tiger breeding programme has been a huge success, with a male and female born three years ago. The precious cubs are now almost fully grown and nearing the age when they could be separated to start their own families. Before the keeper's do this, they want to assess the male's strength and determine if he has developed enough to cope on his own should he be moved to another breeding programme.
