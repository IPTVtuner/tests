Four young people on the cusp of adulthood, all preparing for one of the most important nights of their lives: their Bar or Bat Mitzvah. Dylan, Ayala, Talia and Eve are all about to embark on a uniquely Jewish rite of passage. A boy's Bar Mitzvah, or a girl's Bat Mitzvah, marks their transition to adulthood within the Jewish faith.
