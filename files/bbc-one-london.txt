The team restores four precious heirlooms, including a shattered ceramic poppy for a war veteran, which was created for the art installation at the Tower of London to commemorate the centenary of WW1, and a 1950s hot towel machine passed down a Cypriot family of barbers. Also on the job sheet is a portrait in pastels of a much-missed sister. The first arrival is for ceramics conservator Kirsten Ramsay.
