Sonali Shah scours Hampshire's property market to find somewhere for a couple who are temporarily relying on the goodwill of family. They have a Â£600k budget and want a country home close to the coast. Sticking with a maritime theme, Sonali also gets behind the scenes at the Mary Rose Museum with the treasures uncovered when King Henry VIII's warship was raised after four centuries on the seabed.
