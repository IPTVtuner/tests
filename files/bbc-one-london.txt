Dave the wolf has been suffering from a mysterious illness, and the tough decision the keepers have to make. He was born 13 years ago at the park and was an unabashed troublemaker, forever trying to dodge patrol vehicles in an attempt to get out of his enclosure. He is adored by the keepers, so losing Dave would be heartbreaking. Worse still, he would leave his brother Alf behind. They have never been apart, so there's a chance Alf would struggle to survive as a lone wolf.
