A self-centred young man discovers that he has been disinherited in favour of his autistic older brother, Raymond, who he never knew existed. Incredulous that a man who has no concept of the value of money has been left $3 million, he kidnaps Raymond and heads back to California from Cincinnati. However, Raymond's refusal to fly forces them to drive, and a touching relationship develops along the way.
