Nicki Chapman has the tough, but rewarding task of finding the perfect country home for a house hunter and his wife who have a Â£450,000 budget to escape suburban Surrey and the home he has lived in for more than 60 years. The house hunt may come up roses in more ways than one as Nicki also gets to grips with all things horticultural when she's invited to an exquisite garden for tea, cake and a spot of pruning just before its grand open day.
