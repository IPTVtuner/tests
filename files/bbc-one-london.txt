Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First to arrive at the barn is Jack Laugher with a pair of Olympic medals from the 2016 summer games in Rio de Janeiro, one silver and one gold, and both won by Jack in the diving pool. In the years since this double achievement, Jack has proudly taken his medals to schools to try to inspire the next generation to take up sports.
