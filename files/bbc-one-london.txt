Nicki Chapman reunites with escapees who have made new lives for themselves in rural Devon. Nicki catches up with a homebuyer who, in the summer of 2021, had a modest Â£350,000 budget to secure her dream West Country home. Having discounted all the properties she was shown, she made a surprising U-turn and bought one. Nicki then makes her way to north Devon, where she discovers how a move to a 400-year-old farmhouse has enabled a multi-generational family to flourish.
