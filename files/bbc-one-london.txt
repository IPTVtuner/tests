Ross Kemp presents this quiz show where a team of four - in this episode, friends Catherine, Lisa, Michelle and Helen - take on the Bridge of Lies. One by one, they all face the Bridge, choosing who faces each crossing depending on the question category. Each crossing has 32 potential steps, including 22 truths and ten lies. They must cross the Bridge by stepping on the truths and avoiding the lies, earning money for each correct answer.
