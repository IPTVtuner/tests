To celebrate Easter Sunday, Aled Jones is in Canterbury to explore what this sacred time means to Christians, and to reflect on how the powerful message of Jesus's resurrection still changes lives today. Aled joins a dawn Easter service at St Martin's in Canterbury, the oldest church in the English-speaking world and possibly the first place Easter was publicly celebrated in England.
