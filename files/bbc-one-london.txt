Fiona Bruce and Philip Mould head to north London to meet Glyn Hopkin, a car dealer with a soft spot for art. He's taken a gamble on a painting he hopes is by a towering figure of 18th-century art, Sir Joshua Reynolds. Glyn bought this beguiling picture of a boy on a whim from an online auction in Monaco. Listed as 'in the style of Sir Joshua Reynolds', he decided to take a punt, purchasing the work for £2,700. If it turns out to be genuine, it could be worth £100,000.
