Audacious auctioneers Raj Bisram and Hettie Jago power into the county of Hertfordshire in their 1979 Cadillac. As she celebrates her birthday, Hettie is all about the glamour, indulging in some classic jewellery, a lovely art deco cocktail shaker and even picking up her own slice of Hollywood. Meanwhile, Raj hopes his Inuit carving and glass lamp will shine a winning ray of light on his chances.
