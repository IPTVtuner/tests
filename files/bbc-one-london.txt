We're odds on for a cracking show at Southwell Racecourse in Nottinghamshire, where Nick Hall is riding alongside the reds and Izzie Balmer is in the saddle with the blues. Just down the road from today's fair is Southwell Minster, a place of worship for more than a thousand years. Inside the minster's chapter house, Charlie Ross marvels at the Leaves of Southwell, one of the world's finest examples of 13th-century stone carving.
