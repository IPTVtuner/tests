Hazel Irvine introduces another high-octane afternoon of Olympic action as BMX freestyle, canoe slalom and gymnastics take centre stage on day five in the French capital. Japan are seeking a record fourth successive gymnastics gold in the men's individual all-around final, while the Brits have only ever won two medals in the event - Max Whitlock's bronze in Rio came an eye-watering 108 years after Walter Tysall took silver in 1908.
