It's Children's Week, and Kiell Smith-Bynoe invites the seven remaining sewers to follow the pattern for a child's sequined bomber jacket. With sequins proving tricky to tackle and ribbing around the cuffs and neck, the sewers' skills will once again be under the microscope. For the Transformation Challenge, the sewers are asked to make animal themed fancy dress for a toddler from beach towels with eye-catching results. Finally, the Sewing Bee welcomes mini models for the Made-to-Measure.
