Isa Guha and Mark Chapman bring you highlights of all the action from another busy day in the French capital. There were strong British medal hopes in track cycling, with world champions Emma Finucane and Ethan Hayter competing in the keirin and omnium respectively, while Jade Jones and Bradly Sinden were vying to punch and kick their way to taekwondo glory. The 400m hurdles showdown between Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Femke Bol promised to be one of the highlights of these Games.
