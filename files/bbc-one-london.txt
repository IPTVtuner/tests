The stage is set for today's action-packed showdown at the Detling Showground! This extended version sees two sets of red and blues searching for bargains. Steph Connell is with both of the red teams, while John Cameron captains the blues. After the first teams have shopped, Charlie looks at a small collection dating from the 18th century and learns about the big story behind them, before the second red and blue teams hit the fair!
