This week, Alan puts three new teams through their picture paces: married couple Nic and Corin from Essex, father-son duo Alex and David from Aberdeenshire and Glasgow and friends Abbie and Maddy from Durham. They'll be pitted against each other across four fun and furious rounds against the clock - including the brand new Picture Twist and buzzer rounds - with one pair making it to the final Super Slam. Will they be able to tell their kangaroo from their Doctor Who and take home the jackpot?
