Hazel Irvine hosts another action-packed afternoon in the French capital with diving and track cycling taking centre stage. The men's 3m springboard final features Britain's Jack Laugher in his fourth Olympic appearance. He became the first British diver to win two medals at the same Games in 2016 but will, as ever, face a formidable challenge from the Chinese.
