Stacey and her gang, organiser Dilly, carpenter Rob and cleaner Iwan, challenge the Dowling family to sort their life out in seven days, and in order to do this, they must embark on a mammoth declutter. It's the most cluttered house they have seen so far, and Stacey asks the family to try to let go of at least half their possessions, so that they can then beautifully reorganise their home.
