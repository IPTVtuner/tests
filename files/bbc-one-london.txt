Today, February 17
A young married couple are looking to escape London's Docklands and move to the beautiful Chiltern Hills of Buckinghamshire. Guided by Ginny Buckley, and with a healthy budget of Â£850,000, they want to realise their dream of raising their family with more room inside and more green space out. The property search happens to fall in the same week as the Henley Regatta, where Ginny gets behind the scenes with rowing royalty at this famous societal sporting event.
