Briony May Williams meets a couple from London who are in the market for a new home in the countryside of Oxfordshire or Wiltshire, as long as it has enough space for them and their two young sons. Taking time away from house-hunting, Briony learns why the relatively new practice of not mowing the grass in the month of May is here to stay.
