Today, November 20
Gloria Hunniford, Julia Somerville and the team hear how the promise of a no win, no fee legal action left a man from Burnley with a Â£27,000 legal bill after a firm of solicitors went bust, and he was held liable for the other side's costs. And we hear from the oil rig worker who says he feels let down after his house flooded while he was away, and his insurer refused to pay out.
