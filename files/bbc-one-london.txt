Queen of Scottish antiques, Roo Irvine, comes to grips with the mighty Volvo on the roads of North Yorkshire. Accompanied by her regal rival in relics, Mark Hill. With a fresh Â£200 to spend, their treasure trek sees Roo rifling in Ripon, uncovering a trio of metals, and creating an eye-watering glass lot. Mark hunts for gems in Huntington and gets hot and bothered over a very rare find. During a pit stop in Harrogate, he flexes his nostrils and learns the art of slurping.
