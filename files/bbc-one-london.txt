It's a tale of three countries on this road trip, as good chums and antiques aficionados, Natasha Raskin Sharp and James Braxton, take in Wales, England and Scotland. The last time these two met, Natasha won right at the eleventh hour, so on this rematch, James is keen to level the score. Our purchasing pair starts in south Wales, behind the wheel of a very smart Daimler Sovereign.
