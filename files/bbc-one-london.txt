A traditional Yorkshire Christmas, celebrating the wonder and joy of the Nativity, live from the historic splendour of Halifax Minster. The Minster's choir, accompanied by the famous Hammonds Brass Band, leads the congregation in a host of well-loved carols, including a special arrangement of While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks to the old Yorkshire folk tune On Ilkla Moor Baht'at, one of the earliest tunes for this carol. The service is led by the vicar of Halifax Minster.
