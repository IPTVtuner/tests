Some of the world's biggest names in swimming and athletics battle for the podium on a remarkable night, as Britain go for gold in the pool and on the track. All eyes will be on the women's 100m, one of five athletics finals, with Great Britain's Dina Asher-Smith set to take on Jamaica's Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and American Sha'Carri Richardson. There are also four gold medals to be decided in the pool, with Team GB seeking to defend their Olympic title in the mixed 4x100m medley relay.
