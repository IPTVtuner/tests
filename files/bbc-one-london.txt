DVSA inspectors investigate the cause of an horrific crash in which an HGV careers out of control, smashes through a motorway central reservation and kills two people. The HGV is found to have a defective braking system and is one of a fleet of vehicles operated by a company putting profits before safety. The haulage company's boss faces the prospect of jail after Our Defenders discover he ignored warnings about the defective brakes.
