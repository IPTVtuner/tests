Final shopping shenanigans from dandy duo Roo Irvine and Mark Hill. This time, they're whizzing around Roo's home turf in bonnie Scotland. Drawing on all his expertise, Mark takes a gamble on some glassware, while Roo rummages for Caledonian treasures. They squeeze in a pit stop at St Andrews to learn about women's lacrosse legend Louisa Lumsden, with a lesson that leads to larks on the pitch. Then off to the final showdown in the saleroom. Can Mark outsmart his rival?
