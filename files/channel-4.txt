Gordon travels to Philadelphia to visit a Mexican restaurant called Zocalo. At one point, this restaurant played Cupid to a young couple who met, fell in love and married while working here together. Greg and Mary Russell loved the place so much that they pooled their resources and bought it. However, it seems that Cupid's arrow had a poisoned tip: the restaurant has become an albatross around their necks.
