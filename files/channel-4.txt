Kirstie and Phil lead two more sets of eager house hunters through the property buying maze, this time in north east London. Sarah and Stewart are a couple of cool cats looking for a first home together in Finsbury Park on a very tight budget. Louise and Matt have never lived full time in the same city before, let alone the same house. The couple have Â£350K to spend.
