Kirstie and Phil hit Windsor and Maidenhead for Nicki and Damien, in desperate need of a family home. They have a budget of Â£800,000 but they also have an interesting and at times conflicting list of requirements: Damien would like a watermill, solar panels and a room for a tree-house; Nicki is more interested in the number of bedrooms. Maria is adamant that her new home has to be a bachelorette pad.
