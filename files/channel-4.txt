Bart and Milhouse go on an all-syrup squishee bender, after which Bart awakes with a massive hangover and the memory of embarrassing himself by joining the junior campers. He decides not to quit when he finds out they get to use pocketknives, and sets off to camp, with the embarrassing - and dangerous - Homer in tow.
