Gordon Ramsay travels in the USA, aiming to fix hopeless hotels, mediocre motels and bed & breakfasts with bad standards. In the first programme, Gordon visits Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, to try to rescue the failing Roosevelt Inn. Despite being over a million dollars in debt, the Roosevelt's owner, John Hough, is more interested in telling jokes and dressing up as Sherlock Holmes than he is in fixing his struggling B&B.
