Gordon head to the historic Olde Hitching Post in Hanson, Massachusetts, where he meets an owner so stubborn and set in his ways that he doesn't realise he's the reason his restaurant is losing money. Owner Tom bought the business for his daughter Andrea, but six years later he is still refusing to let her run it. Gordon must fight a controlling boss who doesn't react well to his criticism.
