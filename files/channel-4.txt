Dissatisfied with King Arthur's rule of peace and freedom, Malagant, an erstwhile ally, turns against the Round Table and establishes a hostile domain. However, he goes too far when he kidnaps the queen and imprisons her in an appalling dungeon. The special skills of the glittering and impetuous swordsman Lancelot must be called upon to effect her rescue.
