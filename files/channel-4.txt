Lavish thriller about an idealistic federal agent who vows to bring down Al Capone and his underworld crime syndicate in Prohibition-era Chicago. With police corruption rife, he forms a special team for the task and relies on a veteran street cop - passed over for promotion because he is honest - to clean up the force and trap Capone.
