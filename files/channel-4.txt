Frasier's family and friends organise dates with various women whom they believe are guaranteed to sweep him off his feet. Niles sets Frasier up with Lisa, one of his patients, who owns a bookstore. Roz tries to partner him with artist Suzanne, though it proves a definite mismatch, and Martin introduces Frasier to Kris, an attractive girl from his building, who seems to know every man at the bar.
