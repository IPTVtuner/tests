Kirstie Allsopp and Phil Spencer are back with a brand new series. In Harrow, Kirstie and Phil are searching on behalf of a young couple who are desperate for their first married home together, but who are also very particular about the pricey suburb of Pinner. In Hertfordshire, they go to the assistance of love-struck new parents who have fallen head over heels for each other, and the town of Hitchin.
