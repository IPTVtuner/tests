When a vicious convict breaks out of a San Francisco jail, the tough but weary cop assigned to the case needs all the help he can get, even if that means working with another con. The smart-mouthed, wiseguy prisoner has his own reasons for wanting his fellow con's rampage stopped, and a 48-hour release from jail is arranged so that cop and con can achieve their mutual goal - if they don't kill each other first.
