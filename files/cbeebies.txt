A metal detector has arrived for Ted and he'd like to use it to find his grandad's medal for Nisha's grand exhibition of local historical relics. However, before Pat can get it to Ted he's caught up helping lots of local residents find things they've lost - and happily most of them are metal, so the detector comes in very handy.
