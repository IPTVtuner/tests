Je'naé is cooking her favourite meal of Jamaican saltfish and cabbage. Her family are Jamaican, and in Jamaica saltfish and cabbage is a very popular meal. Lots of people eat it for their breakfast, but Je'naé is cooking it as a very special dinner for her friends. She is using saltfish, fresh cabbage and colourful peppers in her meal. Je'naé's friends have mixed opinions about the taste of fresh green pepper. She hopes that they will like it cooked in her recipe.
