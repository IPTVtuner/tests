Out fishing in the music boat, Small catches a strange-looking object. He doesn't know what it is, but he thinks Tiny might like it, so he gives it to her as a present. At first she is really pleased and puts it in her bedcave. But when she tries to get to sleep, it makes strange shadows on the wall and becomes rather scary. Tiny decides she must get rid of it. But this is not as simple a job as it sounds! Wherever she puts it, it has a mysterious habit of coming back to her bedcave.
