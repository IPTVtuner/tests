Bitz and Bob are making a film about Big Pop. They follow her as she thunders around, sliding down a tree and playing a game of tag with Zip. But then she disappears and they discover she's heading towards Craft City. Things go from bad to worse when Big Pop and Zip end up trapped on top of a high building, too scared to come down.
