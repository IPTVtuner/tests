Today, November 11
With Bitz on drums, Bob on guitar and Bevel on vocals, The Booyahs are ready to perform. Things get even better when they discover that world famous pop star Purl Power is looking for a new band. All they need to do is impress her. Then disaster strikes: Bevel strains his throat and can only sing in a whisper. When singing through a tube proves his voice won't reach the crowd, Bitz sees a giant ice cream cone. It's time for a Bitz brain blitz!
