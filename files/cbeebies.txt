Scarlet is cooking a colourful French vegetarian ratatouille, which her mum has taught her to make. The recipe is full of lovely fresh vegetables that Scarlet chops up and cooks for her friends. Scarlet's friends taste one of the main ingredients before they come round, but aren't too sure about courgettes at first. Hopefully Scarlet's recipe can change their minds. She serves it with french bread and creates a beautiful floral table setting.
