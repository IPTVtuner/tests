One of the chickens is laying her eggs. One chick, two chicks and OOPS! The third chick's legs pop out of the bottom of the egg. Oh dear, it's a little bit stuck! Wait a minute - the egg is running off! Can the Squirrels help bring it back to the chicken safely? There's a big world out there to explore so the Squirrels need to be quick. Oh, and they must make sure they find the right egg to return!
