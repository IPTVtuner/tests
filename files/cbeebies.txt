When the stone cutter is unhappy with his humble job and wants the better things in life, his wishes come true! But after experiencing what it's like to be a rich man, a king and more, he eventually realises that his life before was not so bad after all. Musicians from the BBC Philharmonic are joined by Molly Rainford and guest tabla player Kuljit Bhamra to share a musical retelling of this cyclical tale, which is told in India and many other countries.
