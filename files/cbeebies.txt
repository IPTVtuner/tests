CBeebies
Today, August 15
Dee encourages a friend to say 'r', and we go on an adventure around the sound. We roar, dance like a robot and see a rainbow! The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's letter sound.
