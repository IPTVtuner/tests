Bitz, Bob and Purl are building a giant Mega Wheel in Craft City for Mayor Bevel, and the local citizens are getting very excited. But Bitz has a problem: her tablet has gone missing, and all the instructions on how to finish the Mega Wheel are on it. So while Mayor Bevel tries to keep the impatient crowd happy with his singing and skateboarding skills, Bitz has to try to find a way to finish the Mega Wheel - and quickly! It's attention to detail that saves the day.
