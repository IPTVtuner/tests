Today, March 26
Oliver and his friends have a fun PE lesson with the school sports coach, Mr Beresford. They are pretending to be in a farmyard and cross different obstacles to collect the feed and take it to the chickens. The children take a break and refuel with a healthy fruit snack before Mrs Farrell shows them how to feel calm with a bit of tapping.
