Fred is finding that treasure-hunting when you're hungry is really hard. However, that doesn't stop him and Pete finding a long, black and white-striped metal cone in the sand. They know it's treasure, but what kind? Suzy quickly identifies that it's a horn that makes a loud noise. Suzy sends the boys off to a fishmonger, where Kay points out that the horn is a huer's horn used to helped fishermen find fish. But how could blowing a horn help anyone find fish?
