Duggee puts his delicious homemade apple pie on the windowsill to cool down, but the second his back is turned it's gone. Who took it? Can the Squirrels find out? Fortunately, Duggee has his detective badge - and there are some very small footprints to follow. The Squirrels go and find lots of clues to help Duggee solve the mystery. Being a detective is hard work!
