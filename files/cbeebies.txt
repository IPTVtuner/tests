Duggee thought his tie was a little bit plain, so he added some accessories and now it looks amazing. The Squirrels admire Duggee's new look and want to learn how to accessorise themselves. The first step for the Squirrels is to find something they'd like to change. The Squirrels each bring a different item: wellies, a T-shirt, headband, helmet and a potato. They grab sequins, patches, feathers and lights, and then showcase what they have all done.
