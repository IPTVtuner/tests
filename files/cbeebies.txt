Today, January 24
The school is having a very special lantern parade, so each child gets to make their very own lantern with their face on. Oliver and Felicity are making theirs with help from Mrs Collins. They use a milk bottle for the body, pipe cleaners for arms and coloured paper for clothes, then they add a photo of their face. Once the lanterns have been made, the children hang them on a wire in the playground ready for the parade.
