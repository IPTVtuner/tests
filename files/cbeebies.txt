Today, March 31
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the bottle-top bowtie and remembers the day she got it. Kez has had another idea - a trash fashion range, and Bob is helping her by bringing in boxes of old clothes. She repays him with a `waste coat', a waistcoat made entirely out of stuff most people would throw away. Kez is sure that, with Bob wearing it around the Big Hub, it will be a great advert for her range.
