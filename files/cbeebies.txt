Today, December 21
Jocelyn MacNab, Joshua Lester, Anna Acton, Chris Hannon, Suzy Aitchison, Abigail O'Brien. Live-action children's show. It's the night before Christmas, and Topsy and Tim finish decorating the tree. The twins enjoy wrapping gifts for Mummy and Dad, dancing around the living room and hanging up their stockings. Before going to sleep, Topsy and Tim sneak a look out of the bedroom window for Father Christmas and enjoy a magical surprise.
