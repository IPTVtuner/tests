Meagaidh the Border Collie is a search and rescue dog who works with her owner, Tom. Her supernose follows scents and smells like clues, so they can rescue people who need their help. Annie is in a kayak, but she's lost her map and is totally lost. She's managed to paddle to a beach, but she's cold and wet and has hurt her wrist. At the Woofton Search and Rescue Centre, Tom and Meagaidh need to find Annie, and fast!
