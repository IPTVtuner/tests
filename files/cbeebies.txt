Bitz and Bob are on the lookout for spaceships in the Big Hot Sandy Desert when a rocket crash-lands near them. They rush off to help and meet two aliens who speak a very strange language. They call them Plipp and Zopp and manage to discover that they need to get back to space in time for granny alien's birthday.
