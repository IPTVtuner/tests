Today, November 15
Bella is spending a lot of time with her `other' friends and it seems that cornet lessons, the community concert and hanging out with Laila seem a little uncool. Laila is unhappy about losing a friend but Sam and Eli are convinced Bella won't miss the opportunity to dress up and go on the storytelling trip. However, Bella is convinced that her other friends are `totes' amazing and looks on course to let her friends and the community band down.
