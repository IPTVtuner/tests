Tag is feeling grumpy because he didn't eat his breakfast. Luckily, Duggee has his Breakfast Badge, so he can make whatever the Squirrels would like to eat - and it turns out they all like very different things for breakfast! The Squirrels learn all about how different animals fuel themselves in the mornings, earning their Breakfast Badges in the process. Tag finally gets his toast, helping power him through the day. Well done Squirrels!
