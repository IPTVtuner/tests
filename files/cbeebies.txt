Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how lichen plays such an important role in the environment. They find out that lichen loves to grow in places where the air is clean, can be used by birds to build nests and be food for insects and animals too. On the way, they take time to enjoy the beautiful nature they see and find something interesting under a log!
