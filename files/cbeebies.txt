Talented young chef Ben is cooking German zwiebelkuchen. Ben's parents are German, and zwiebelkuchen is a very popular recipe in Germany. It is one of Ben's favourite foods, so he is very happy to teach us all to make it. Zwiebelkuchen is an onion tart that is made from pastry, onions and German ham. Ben is adding lots of extra flavour by using caraway seeds.
