CBeebies
Today, March 17
In an attempt to apologise to Kari for eating the cake she made him as a surprise, Barry tries to be kind in lots of different ways by becoming Captain Kind Kid! Even though a cake he makes for her is less than perfect, Kari loves it and sees the kindness of the gesture. We meet a group of Treasure Champs who are giving out kindness gifts to people, and another who is collecting donations for a local food bank.
