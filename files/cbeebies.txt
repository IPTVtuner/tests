Bing is teaching Charlie how to throw, but when he throws the ball in the lounge it knocks the fruit over! Bing starts to explain, but Charlie interrupts, leaving Flop to believe Charlie did it. Bing happily shows Charlie how to voosh Squeaky instead, but it flies out of his hands and hits Flop's tray of snacks! After some encouragement, Bing tells Flop the truth and apologises.
