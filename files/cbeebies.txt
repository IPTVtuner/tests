When Mr Hammond inadvertently eats all the mangosteen fruit that was meant for the new treeshrews, it's up to Andy to find some more. Jetting off in his safari-mobile, Andy heads to the rainforests of Borneo in search of a treeshrew and its favourite food, mangosteens. Along the way, Andy comes face to face with a tree snake and some hungry wild pigs.
