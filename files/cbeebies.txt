CBeebies
Today, July 25
Dee encourages a friend to say 'c', and we go on an adventure around the sound. We see some cute coconuts, a campervan, and meet a cool camel! The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's letter sound!
