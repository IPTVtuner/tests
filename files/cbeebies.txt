Kika is a golden labrador and guide dog for her owner Dr Amit, who is blind, which means he cannot see. She is trained to use her supersight to help Dr Amit do as many things as he can by himself. Together, they make the best team! Dr Amit is helping Raj the grocer judge the carrots in the fruit and veg competition at the Woofton country fair. Kika is helping Dr Amit, including with the mouthwatering task of finding the tastiest carrot in Woofton!
