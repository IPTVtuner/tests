Visiting the hospital is Jobi, who is having a CT scan to make sure everything is okay with his brain. Dr Ranj explains that the scan will allow him to take special photographs of inside Jobi's head, allowing him to make sure everything is working as it should be. When inside the machine - which Jobi thinks looks like a doughnut - Jobi must keep very still so Dr Ranj can perform the scan.
