Aksara is cooking a curry from Sri Lanka which contains a very special ingredient: tamarind paste. Her friends find the taste quite unusual at first, so let's hope they like it in the finished curry, once it has been cooked with lots of other lovely ingredients. Aksara has so many delicious ingredients to prepare that she has to get her sister to help! Aksara serves the curry in a traditional way - with rice and roti bread, on a banana leaf and with no knives and forks.
