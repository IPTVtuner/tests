Coco is showing Bing how magnets work. While Coco builds a tower, Bing wants to find more magnetic things. In the garden he tests the ball, table and key, announcing which are magnetic. When Bing tries the watering can, he accidentally drops the magnet behind the flowerbed! Neither Bing nor Coco can reach it, so Flop shows them how to fish with magnets.
