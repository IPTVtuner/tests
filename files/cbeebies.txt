Today, November 15
Duggee is sewing a snazzy poncho, and the Squirrels want to make one too. They all get down to some sewing and it's very quiet in the clubhouse until they hear a very loud sneeze! It's so loud that everything starts to shake. Where is it coming from? Duggee and the Squirrels go off and investigate, following the sneezes all the way to a polar bear with a very bad cold. He needs a hanky. What could they use instead?
