Rapids Johnson happens upon a woodland cinema and enjoys watching a bear song and dance in an old movie. Out in the park, Keith Fitt has got another Champion Tip, this one is about serving a tennis ball. Gail Force is standing by with another installment of her chatshow, Gail. When her guest, the fastest tap dancer in the world, fails to turn up, Gail puts on her dancing shoes and performs a funny tap dance.
