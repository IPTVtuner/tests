Today, March 28
Dee encourages a friend to say `strawberry', and goes on a whirlwind word adventure. Grow strawberries, pick them and enjoy eating yummy ones. There are skipping and space strawberries, and Dee even does the samba with one. The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's word.
