Today, June 24
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the empty pickle jar and remembers the day she got it. Moira's plan to relax with a nice cup of tea at the Wobbly Coffee Pot is spoiled when she discovers Mrs Juniper is going to visit her sister and is closing the cafe for the day.
