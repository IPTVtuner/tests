Kay has invited his friends to taste his Polish dill pickle soup, which his mum has shown him how to cook all by himself. Dill pickle is a popular Polish ingredient and Kay gets his friends to taste it before they eat the soup. Not all of his friends like the taste at first, but Kay hopes they will all enjoy the finished soup. As well as dill pickle, he uses spring onions, potatoes and carrot in his soup.
