Today, October 12
It's moving day. Topsy and Tim help Mummy and Dad and the removal people pack their belongings into a big van, ready to be taken to their new home. Tony Welch and his family come to collect the twins' bunk beds before Topsy and Tim say goodbye to their old house and friends. The twins are excited, especially when Mr Fishwick gives them the best moving present ever!
