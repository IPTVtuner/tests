When a weaver ant nest arrives damaged, Andy must stick it back together - but how? He jets off in his safari-mobile to Australia, discovering how weaver ants build their nests and what they use to stick the leaves together. Will Andy succeed? And will he get back to Safari World before Mr Hammond notices the other nest was destroyed?
