Kari has sacrificed time and energy preparing for an obstacle race in the hope of winning a trophy for her collection, but Barry hasn't trained and struggles in the race. Kari sacrifices her chance of winning to go back and help her friend, and to say thanks Barry gives her one of his trophies, which Kari puts in pride of place with her other awards.
