When the Squirrels can't figure out if fish have noses, Duggee shows them his library. But when the Squirrels realise no-one is visiting it, they have an idea. A mobile library. The Squirrels set off with Duggee. Along the way, they help Tino find his creativity, King Tiger figure out his favourite ice cream flavour and Worm find her love of fantasy. The Squirrels learn just how helpful and informative a library can be.
