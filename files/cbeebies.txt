Izaac is making a traditional recipe from his home county of Lancashire. The Chorley cakes are made from circles of pastry filled with a fruity filling of dried cherries and currants. Izaac works hard tickling the flour and butter together before turning it into dough, which he then has to carefully roll out. When Izaac's friends arrive he gives them a red rose, the symbol of Lancashire. Will Izaac's friends guess the special ingredient and will they enjoy it in his Chorley cakes?
