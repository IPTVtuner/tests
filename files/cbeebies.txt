Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how woodlice play an important role in the environment. They find out that they are very adaptable and can live in lots of damp and dark places. They learn that woodlice are one of nature's cleaners, cleaning up things like old leaves and dead wood and helping to recycle nutrients back into the soil. On the way, they spot some woodlice in a compost heap and do the woodlouse walk!
