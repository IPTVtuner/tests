When the meerkats escape from Safari World, it's up to Andy to jet off in his safari-mobile to the Kalahari Desert in Africa to record a meerkat alarm call that will bring them running home. But a scorpion and cobra thwart his every move. Will Andy make it back to Safari World in time before Mr Hammond notices the meerkats are missing?
