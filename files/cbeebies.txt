CBeebies
Today, May 20
When Mali and Bella see a person dressed like a spaceman in the community garden, they start to worry about aliens invading the estate. Grandma Zainab points out that it's actually a bee keeper looking after honey bees. Bella feels sad when Kobi reports that the bee keeper is looking to close down the hive because Mr Murphy from number thirty-nine can't look after it any more.
