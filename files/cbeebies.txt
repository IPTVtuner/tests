It's Silas and his classmates' first full day at school! There are lots of things to explore, new friends to make and teachers to meet. After meeting the teachers, the children explore the classroom and outdoor area. At lunchtime, Ottilie and Bryn 'spot' an invisible mouse in the dining hall. Lusungu finds that opening yogurt lids can be a bit tricky.
