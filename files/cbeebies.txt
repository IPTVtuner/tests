Today, January 15
Bing gets all his favourite games out to play with Charlie, but when Charlie arrives he doesn't want to play any of them. Bing is upset until Flop suggests they watch to see what Charlie does want to do. Charlie heads straight for the kitchen - where he and Bing both have a great time making music with pots and pans.
