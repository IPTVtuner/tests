Wizard Tripwick and Dina Lady join Gail and Keith for today's GiggleQuiz. Gail asks Wizard Tripwick to conjure up a thinking cap to help her win a gigglepoint. A few failed attempts later, Wizard Tripwick magics up something Gail can work with: a hat with a sink on top. Arthur comments that Gail's new headwear looks more like a sinking Cap than a thinking cap, but Gail is keen to test it out.
