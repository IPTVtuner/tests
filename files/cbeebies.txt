Love Monster is on a road trip with Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny in her carrot car. Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny is finally going to Carrot Rock Canyon just like her great-great-aunt did. However, they find the route a lot harder than they thought. When they finally end up in Carrot Rock Canyon, Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny thanks Love Monster for taking the hard way, and they take some photos of themselves at the amazing canyon.
