Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how seeds play such an important role in the environment. They find out about the different ways that seeds can disperse so they grow into new plants and trees, how they can be food for animals, and that we can eat some too. On the way, they feed seeds to the ducks, before stopping off for a picnic of fruit that grew from seeds.
