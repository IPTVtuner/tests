Today, September 11
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the baby bookmark and remembers the day she got it. Alice is in the Wobbly Coffee Pot with Molly when she feels that her baby might be on its way. Moira and Mrs Juniper are alarmed, but a calm Molly goes to find James. At the Kids Club, the children are planning to make a 'Welcome to the Big Hub' card for the baby. Molly arrives looking for James, who has gone into town.
