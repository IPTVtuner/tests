Snail is thrilled to be moving house as she wishes to escape the wet and sploshy place she currently calls home to a more spacious house on the hill. But before she can move up in the world, she's going to need some help from Duggee and the Squirrels to move her many belongings up the hill. Snail can't do it alone, so Duggee teaches the Squirrels the best ways that they can get moving! They band together, cradling items and shifting furniture.
