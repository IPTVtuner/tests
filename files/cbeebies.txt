Bella?s not happy that Finn hasn?t shown up for the playdate. Bella had planned a whole new game requiring her friends to play in pairs, but Finn?s no-show leaves an odd one out. Later Finn reveals that he didn?t show up because of his fear of Bella?s cat. Bella, Mali and Annie all help Finn understand the relationship between humans and animals, but can they convince Finn that there?s nothing to be scared of?
