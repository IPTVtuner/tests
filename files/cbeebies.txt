A makes friends with a cat but soon starts sneezing and bouncing all over. Her friends try to help, but everything they do only makes things worse. How can she sneak away from the cat? This episode has fun with the letters A, C, P, T and N and the words 'cat', 'can', 'pat', 'tap', 'cap', 'nap' and 'dog'.
