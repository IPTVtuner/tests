Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the `boss' badge and remembers the day she got it. Mack has to go to the dentist and leaves Molly in charge of the stall. Mrs Stewart wants to buy Euan a thanks you present for helping her, so Molly sells her a toy robot. When Mack arrives back, he tells her that the robot was not for sale and that he was fixing it for Euan.
