Joining Gail and Keith for today's GiggleQuiz are the Lost Pirate and Ann Teak. Partway through, the Lost Pirate discovers that there is treasure buried somewhere in the studio. Gail offers to help the Lost Pirate dig but then falls straight into the hole the Lost Pirate is digging! As the quiz comes to a close, Arthur welcomes Dan Step into studio to help tidy up. Dan tap dances across the studio with his vacuum cleaner and makes light work of all the mess.
