Today, December 18
When Andy inadvertently loses some kapok tree seeds that Mr Hammond was hoping to plant in the chimp enclosure, it's up to Andy to jet off to Africa in his safari-mobile and track down some more. Shrinking down to the size of a baby chimp, he embarks on an epic adventure, swinging through the trees in search of replacement kapok seeds.
