CBeebies
Today, November 26
Banoffi pie was thought to have been invented in Sussex, and today Sonny-Mac is showing us how to make it. Sonny-Mac puts bananas and cream on top of a tasty base of crushed biscuits. He also adds his special ingredient, dates, to make it lovely and sweet. Not all his friends like the taste of dates at first, so let's hope they enjoy them when the pie is ready. Sonny-Mac serves the pie to his friends at a special tea party, where everyone dresses very smartly.
