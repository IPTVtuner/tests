David's friend Laila is keen to look after Nibbles, the school hamster, during the holidays, but her dad isn't so keen. When David and Sam convince Kobi to let them take care of Nibbles during the school break, Laila is delighted that she will get to spend time with the pet too. Unfortunately, things don't quite go to plan, and Grandma Zainab must help Mali and Laila do some extra special solving to prevent a hamster catastrophe.
