Today, June 25
Dee encourages a friend to say `dinosaur', and goes on a whirlwind word adventure. See lots of dinosaurs, big, baby and scaly ones. There's a stomping, running, disco and even a drumming dinosaur. The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's word.
