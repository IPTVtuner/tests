Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's Stall. She chooses the lock of purple hair and remembers the day she got it. Caitlin wants to play with her granny, but Moira is too busy. Later at Alice's stall, Magnus is buying a 'World's Greatest Granny' mug and tells Caitlin how fun and cool his granny is - she has purple hair. Moira overhears this but walks away before hearing Caitlin say that her granny is the greatest granny too.
