Newfoundland Sylvie is a big therapy dog with big soft cuddles who loves to help people when they're worried. She and her owner Katrina visit all sorts of people every day, young and old. Sylvie and Katrina are visiting some schoolchildren on their very first day at school. Sylvie knows the children will be feeling nervous and excited all at once.
