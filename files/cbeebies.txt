Lola is sure that she is a good dancer, but some dancing is a bit too swirly, ballet is too floaty, while tap dancing is too shuffly and not tappy enough. Just when she thinks she will never ever be any good, Lola finds a way of combining all the different dances and coming up with one big special dance all of her own - Lola dancing.
