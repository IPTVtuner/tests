When Andy leaves his sandwich in the lion enclosure, it attracts an infestation of flies, just as Mr Hammond is hoping to take pictures of the lions for the park's website. Andy jets off to Africa in his safari-mobile to see how lions in the wild deal with flies. Along the way he meets an agama lizard who just might have the solution to Andy's predicament.
