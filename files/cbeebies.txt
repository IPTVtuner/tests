There's a new Cowboy Colin book and the children of Greendale are excited that their teacher Lauren has ordered a copy of the book and is going to read it to them once Pat has delivered it. The problem is, everyone else in Greendale is excited too and wants to have a look. Pat is delayed and once his van runs out of petrol he has no choice but to jump on Pumpkin and ride to school.
