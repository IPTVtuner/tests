Indigo is showing us how to make a desert from New Zealand called pavlova. She works hard whisking the egg whites to make crispy nests called meringues. These are filled with kiwi fruit, a fruit that is named after a bird from New Zealand! Indigo also adds strawberries and whipped cream to her meringues. When her friends arrive, Indigo greets them with a traditional New Zealand greeting. Let's hope Indigo's friends like the taste of kiwi fruit when they eat it in her pavlova!
