Today, March 28
King Tiger interrupts the Squirrels' quiet time when he turns up to the Clubhouse with a magic hat on instead of his crown. King Tiger puts on a magic show for the Squirrels, making things appear and disappear to the Squirrels' enthusiastic requests. The magic hat creates things from small to big, from mice to an elephant. The Squirrels are amazed, and the show is going well until the elephant lands on the hat, breaking it!
