Today, November 12
There is an amazing seahorse merry-go-round on the beach, and everyone is having lots of fun going round and round, except Bevel. When he runs away from the ride, Bob finds him, only for Bevel to admit he's nervous about going in circles. Everyone joins in to help him overcome his fear and soon he's sitting on his seahorse, Blue Yah, excited about his first turn on a merry-go-round.
