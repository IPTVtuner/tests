Bing wants to draw a big picture, so Flop finds him some chalk to draw on the pavement. Bing draws a fabulous stripy, spotty, zig-zag dinosaur, but just as he's finished a rain shower washes the dinosaur away. Bing is devastated until he sees that a bit of dinosaur is left behind, and with that new beginning there is another chalk something waiting to be created.
