Newfoundland Sylvie is a big therapy dog with big soft cuddles who loves to help people when they're worried. She and her owner, Katrina, visit all sorts of people every day, young and old. Today Sylvie and Katrina are visiting a doctor's surgery to help a little boy called Ben. Ben has fallen off his scooter and grazed his knee, and his mum says he's too nervous to come into the doctor's room. Sylvie's mission is to help Ben feel brave enough to see Dr Stevens.
