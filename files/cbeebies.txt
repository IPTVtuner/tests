Newfoundland Sylvie is a therapy dog with big soft cuddles who loves to help people when they're worried. She and her owner Katrina visit all sorts of people every day, young and old. It's Sylvie and Katrina's day off, and they're planning a special lunch at the park caf√©. At the bus stop, they meet Dawn from the toy shop, who is worried that her bus is running late. But seeing Sylvie waiting calmly inspires Dawn to do the same.
