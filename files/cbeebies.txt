Today, May 18
Marv and Charlie are off to the insect house and Marv's little brother Morton is coming round to play with Lola. Lola is very excited and is sure that Morton will be her new friend who lives down the stairs. However, Morton is very shy indeed and Lola has to draw on all her resources to get him to play with her at all.
