Wizard Tripwick and Dina Lady join Gail and Keith for today's GiggleQuiz. Inspired by two musical clips, Gail Force is keen to perform a song at the end of the show. Gail teaches Wizard Tripwick how to warm up his voice with some rather unique vocal exercises. As the third round begins, Gail takes over the show and plays a clip of her singing. Afterwards, Gail suggests that everyone should sing their answers.
