CBeebies
Today, March 24
Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how beavers play an important role in the environment. They find out that they are amazing eco-engineers who create watery habitats by building dams from trees they chop down. They learn that the pools and ponds the beavers make can support many different plants and animals too. On the way, they spot a beaver who has just woken up to start its night's work.
