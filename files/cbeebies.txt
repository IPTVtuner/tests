Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how allotments play an important role in the environment. They find out why they are great places to grow fruit and vegetables, explore a compost heap where worms and birds live and spot a water butt which recycles rainwater. On the way, they enjoy the peace and quiet of the allotment, before planting some potatoes.
