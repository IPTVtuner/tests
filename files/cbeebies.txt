Molly brings the flavours of the Caribbean to her home by cooking up a Saint Lucian-themed meal for her friends. She makes a feast of jerk sea bass, spiced potato wedges and a tangy avocado and pineapple salsa. Molly loves cooking and has learnt to make this flavourful feast from her dad, who is originally from St Lucia. Her friends taste some raw spring onions and tell us what they think.
