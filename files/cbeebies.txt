Small decides that there should be a Dragon Day to thank the Soup Dragon for being so kind as to provide them with soup every day. The Soup Dragon is quite overcome, especially when everyone gives her presents. The Iron Chicken arrives late and exhausted, but it turns out that her present is the best of all.
