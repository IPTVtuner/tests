Maddie looks inside things. Take a look inside a kaleidoscope to learn how it uses three mirrors called a triangular prism to make colourful patterns. Maddie uses a special camera to show exactly how different patterns are made. Next, she visits a factory where we see how envelopes are made. Lots of paper is used with a very long machine called an envelope machine, which makes the envelopes really, really quickly! Maddie uses a special camera to look at the see-through film.
