Charlotte's dad is Irish and he has shown Charlotte how to make Irish boxty for her friends. Ireland is an interesting place and we learn all about it as Charlotte cooks her meal. She uses mashed and grated potatoes to make her boxty, and she flavours the potato mixture with lots of delicious ingredients including fresh rosemary. Charlotte thinks that rosemary smells like fresh air but some of her friends are not so keen and don't really like the taste of rosemary on its own.
