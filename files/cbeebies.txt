Small is out fishing and Baby Soup Dragon is helping his Mum, so Tiny has no one to play with. He plays catch by himself but it's not much fun. Major Clanger notices that Tiny looks bored and makes him a special cone-shaped gadget which launches a cotton ball up into the air for the user to catch in the cone. Mother calls Tiny to ask for some help in the garden and Tiny leaves the gadget on the floor while she goes off to help her Mum. But when she gets back, the gadget has disappeared.
