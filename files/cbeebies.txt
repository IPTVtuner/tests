CBeebies
Today, August 22
Dee encourages a friend to say 'w', and we go on an adventure around the sound. We play in some water, see a worm and wear some wigs! The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's letter sound.
