Charlie and Marv are trying to do their Spanish homework, which sparks an interest in Lola to speak Spanish too. The boys say she is too young to speak Spanish, so Lola decides she wants to go to Spainland immediately, even though the boys say that is totally impossible. Lola and Soren Lorenson then decide to invent their own land and their own language.
