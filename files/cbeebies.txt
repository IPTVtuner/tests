Today, November 20
Dee encourages a friend to say `drum' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. We see and hear lots of different drums - a loud drum, a marching drum, a tap it drum and a whack it drum! We all have a dance to a steel drum, see a tiny mouse playing a rum pum drum and enjoy Dee playing a set of drums at a big concert.
