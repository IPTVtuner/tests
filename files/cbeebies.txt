Today, September 18
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the glitter pen and remembers the day she got it. Everyone at the Big Hub wants to know one thing - what's the new baby's name? Alice and James are coming in to announce it later, and Molly and Mack have been sworn to secrecy. Caitlin decides she's going to hold a 'guess the baby's name' competition. The prize is glitter pens from the Kids Club.
