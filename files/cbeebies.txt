CBeebies
Today, February 10
Dee encourages a friend to say `key' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. We see lots of different keys and explore how they look and what they do. We see a silver key, a locking key, a car key and a castle key. There's a magic key, a fun key and Dee even loses her keys.
