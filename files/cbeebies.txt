Today, April 30
Duggee and the Squirrels are going camping. They need to find somewhere to pitch their tent but it's not as easy as they thought it would be. They all work together and finally get settled. But Tag realises he can't sleep without his teddy, and Happy would like a glass of water. Suddenly Duggee is up and down and in and out of the tent getting everything the Squirrels need. In fact, Duggee works so hard that he's the first to fall asleep.
