The Squirrels are at the Clubhouse playing, but they can't stop thinking about the dreams they had last night. Luckily, Duggee has his dream badge and can help the Squirrels work out what they mean. As the Squirrels think about dreams, all the different dreams of the Clubhouse friends become weirder and more wonderful. We even get to see Duggee's dream.
