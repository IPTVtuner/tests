Bitz promises to build a strong house for Little Bo Purl's goats and for the three little pigs, one that big bad Robo Wolf can't blow down. First they build the cutest little house out of straw, but Robo Wolf soon huffs and puffs and blows it away. Then they build a house out of sticks, but he blows that one down too and all they have left to use is some snow - and how can you build a house out of soft squishy snow? It's time for a Bitz brain blitz!
