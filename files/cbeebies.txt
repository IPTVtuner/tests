The Squirrels are playing hide-and-seek and come across a pink snorting fluffy animal, a scruffelump. The Squirrels are excited and want to keep the scruffemlump as their pet, but Duggee is wary. Keeping a pet is a lot of work. They need feeding, cleaning, exercising and much more that will keep you very busy. But they are wonderful too and can bring a lot of love to life.
