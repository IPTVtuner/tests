CBeebies
Today, April 15
Dee encourages a friend to say `robot', and goes on a whirlwind word adventure. See a red robot, a smiling robot, a building robot, a sleeping robot and a helping robot. Dee meets a bleeping robot and has a boogie with a group of dancing robots. The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's word.
