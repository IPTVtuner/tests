Today, January 24
Bing, Sula, Pando, Coco and Charlie have all dressed up for Halloween. Bing tries to surprise Charlie by wearing his Biteysaurus mask, but it works too well and scares Charlie so much that he cries. Bing thinks that Charlie does not like him anymore, but Flop helps Bing to understand that Charlie thinks Biteysaurus is real. Bing shows Charlie that Biteysaurus has not eaten Bing - he is Bing!
