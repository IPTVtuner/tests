Today it is the turn of talented young cook Mason, who is making a traditional recipe from Yorkshire. Mason's recipe, yorkshire pudding, is named after the place it comes from, and he hopes all his friends will like it as much as he does. Mason serves his recipe with broccoli, parsley and traditional Yorkshire gravy. One of his ingredients is horseradish, which none of his friends like the taste of at first.
