Two teams touch down at the STARS space station to take on three scientific challenges to win out-of-this world prizes. First, they must use their knowledge of forces by pumping air into balloons attached to rockets to land them on a target. Then, in a game based on light and shadows, the young scientists have to figure out what their team captains are holding by observing their shadows behind a huge screen.
