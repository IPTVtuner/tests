Bing finds his old baby shoes. They are much too small for Bing now, but Coco loves them and so does baby Charlie. When they fit Charlie, Bing has a hard time letting them go to a new home until Charlie's first steps help Bing to realise they will be more use to someone whose feet are the right size.
