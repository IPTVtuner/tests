CBeebies
Today, June 29
Join Evie as she takes Dodge to his very first festival. Experience lots of summer fun as Dodge dresses up, dances to music and tries new things along the way. It's brimming with sunshine, songs, a festival story and a festival wristband to make. Come along to our CBeebies festival extravaganza and spot some surprise friends. You're all invited!
