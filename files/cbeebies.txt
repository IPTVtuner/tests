Today, November 13
Dee encourages a friend to say `egg' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. We see lots of different eggs, a brown egg, a white egg, we even see inside an egg. There's a dippy egg, a fried egg, an egg being laid and what will come out of the hatching egg? There's a gold egg, a cold egg and Dee and her friends even have an egg and spoon race.
