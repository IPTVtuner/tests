Today, June 19
The Squirrels are out doing their exercises when, suddenly, a cheetah called Chipo comes along with his dance crew. He criticises them for not being able to dance in time, and it turns out Duggee used to be part of the dance crew. Duggee was a great dancer, but he never stuck to the choreography and was always making up his own moves. But the Squirrels don't know what choreography is. The Rock Slippy Crew show off some impressive moves but keep criticising Duggee's moves.
