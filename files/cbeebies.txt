CBeebies
Today, March 05
The class has a visit from a vet, Evan, who gives the children advice on looking after pets. Evan asks Leon and Ottilie to help him check over the class guinea pigs, Teddy and Eddie, and they get a clean bill of health. Finally, Mrs Bailey, Leon and Ottilie clean out the guinea pig hutch, but will all the wood shavings make it into the hutch or end up on Ottilie?
