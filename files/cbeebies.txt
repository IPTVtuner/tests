Today, December 03
Bitz, Bob and Purl are on a treasure hunt in Big Hot Sandy Desert. Bob finds a dusty old lamp, and a quick polish reveals it's the home of Bevel Genie and his pets, Zup and Pup. Bevel Genie does the genie thing and grants them three wishes, but then announces it's time for them to go home. On hearing this, Zup and Pup excitedly race towards the lamp and it goes flying into the air, landing on top of a cactus.
