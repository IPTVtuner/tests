Mateo's mum is from Chile and she has shown him how to make a special Chilean dish. Sopaipillas are made with sweet potato dough and served with a colourful pebre made from tomatoes, spring onions and coriander. Mateo decorates his table with lots of plants and colourful flowers. There are even a few alpacas and llamas joining the party! Mateo also shows off his dancing skills to his friends while wearing a traditional Chilean costume.
