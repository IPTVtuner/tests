CBeebies
Today, November 12
Jake is making traditional Australian meat pies using a recipe that his dad has shown him. Jake makes two sets of different sized pastry circles and fills them with a mixture made from lamb mince. One of Jake's ingredients is black pepper, but his friends are not too sure about the taste when they try it before the meal. Let's hope they enjoy it in the cooked pies!
