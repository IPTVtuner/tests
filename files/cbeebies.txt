When park boss Mr Hammond accidentally breaks some acorns in the Jungle Den, it's up to Andy to jet off in his safari-mobile to Canada and collect some more. He shrinks down to embark on an epic adventure with a chipmunk, discovering its underground den. Along the way, he also meets a moose and must escape from a horned owl.
