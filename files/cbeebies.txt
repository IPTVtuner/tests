Duggee is cleaning out the workshop but he needs the squirrels's help. The squirrels work hard but when they finish they can't find Duggee. Oh! They have built a maze out of all the things in Duggee's workshop. Duggee is right in the middle of the maze, but can the squirrels find the right way in? And once they're in, can they find the way out again?
