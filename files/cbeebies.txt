Today, February 22
Bing and Sula find a helium balloon stuck in a tree in the park. They both want to play with it at the same time so Flop makes two strings and they invent a noisy balloon game called stuck duckies. When they run in opposite directions the balloon flies away, and Flop volunteers to be the stuck duckie so the game doesn't have to end.
