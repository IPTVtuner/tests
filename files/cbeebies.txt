Maddie is out and about. She finds out how revolving doors can let lots of people in and out of buildings at the same time. She visits a revolving door workshop to see how panels of glass are fixed to something called a carousel so that the panels move when we push them. Then she uses a special camera to show how a sensor at the top of an automatic revolving door spots us so it can start to turn. Next, Maddie heads to a neon sign workshop and uses her thermal imaging camera.
