Today, April 24
Joining Gail and Keith for today's GiggleQuiz are Captain Adorable and Rapids Johnson. Partway through, Gail suddenly remembers that she hasn't put her lucky mascot Lorraine the Lion on the desk. Captain Adorable is scared of Lorraine at first, but his fear subsides when Gail provides the lion with a superhero mask and cape. Super Lorraine is the perfect sidekick for Captain Adorable, and he whizzes off to give his new teammate a flying lesson.
