Duggee is blowing up balloons for Tino the artistic mouse's birthday. When they give the tiny mouse a big bunch of balloons something unexpected happens. Tino starts to float up into the sky! He's having a rather good time until he gets stuck in a tree. It's time for the squirrels to come to his rescue.
