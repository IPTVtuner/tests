Today, March 20
It's a new day, and Mrs Farrell is checking in with all the children to see how they are. Lucas tells her he is looking for more friends to play with, and there are lots of volunteers! Isla, Otto and Jud bake some delicious tiger ginger biscuits, using coloured icing for roar-some decorations. At playtime, Jud asks if she can play with Lucas, and they have a fun-filled game of chase. The day ends with carpet-time, and Lucas is happy with his new-found friends.
