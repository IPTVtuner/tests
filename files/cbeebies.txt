Newfoundland Sylvie is a big therapy dog with big soft cuddles who loves to help people when they're worried. She and her owner Katrina visit all sorts of people every day, young and old. Sylvie and her owner Katrina are helping a girl called Akilah, who is joining the local school after arriving from a foreign country. Lots of things will be very different for her, so Sylvie will need her super heart to make her feel as welcome as possible.
