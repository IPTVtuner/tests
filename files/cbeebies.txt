Two teams touch down at the STARS space station to take on three scientific challenges to win out-of-this world prizes. First, the teams must guess which animals Sam and Ayo are looking at through their telescope based on a series of clues. Then there's a fast-paced game based on personal hygiene, where the young scientists must race against the clock to brush as much food as possible off giant teeth. Finally, the teams must make their way across a giant inflatable version of the solar system.
