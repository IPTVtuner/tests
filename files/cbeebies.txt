Today, October 30
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the important letter and remembers the day she got it. Mack is surprised to get a letter telling him he's got a place on a music and performing arts course, as he didn't apply. He would need to act and dance as well as sing, and he doesn't think he can do either.
