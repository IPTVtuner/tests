Balthazar is in the kitchen cooking a traditional Turkish revani cake, helped by his sister Serena and brother Ted. Coconut is a really important ingredient in his recipe, as it is put in the cake as well as on top. Balthazar invites his friends to taste the coconut before he cooks it, but they don't like it very much. He thinks he'll change their minds when they taste his finished cake.
