Joining Keith and Gail for today's GiggleQuiz are Captain Adorable and Dina Lady. Keith asks Dina Lady to play football with him, but Dina apologises, saying she needs to make a chocolate sandwich cake for today's winning team. Soon Dina ends up multitasking, showing off some impressive header skills whilst decorating her cake. The third round features a clip starring GiggleQuiz's own Keith Fitt, and he's confident the win is in the bag!
