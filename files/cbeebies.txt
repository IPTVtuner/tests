Connor lives in Scotland. He makes a delicious vegetarian haggis, to share with his friends. He serves his tasty haggis with freshly mashed neeps and tatties. As an extra special surprise, Connor has arranged for a special guest to play the Scottish bagpipes as the haggis is served, and his friends have no idea about this special surprise! They are all looking forward to trying the food, but they were not very keen on fresh coriander, which is one of the ingredients.
