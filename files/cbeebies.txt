Bing and Sula head off for a picnic at the paddling pool with Flop. But when they get there, they are shocked to find there is no water inside. Bing's disappointment soon gives way to the realisation that it's a very special pool day. With no water there are all sorts of games they can play that are usually against the pool rules.
