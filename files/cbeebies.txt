Yakka Dee! celebrates children communicating - because talking fills you up with whizz, pop, bang! In this episode, Dee encourages a friend to say 'car' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. We see lots of different cars and explore how they look and what they do. We see a big car, a little car and a child whose bed is a car. There's a yucky dirty car, Dee takes a bath with a clean car and someone has a car cake for their birthday.
