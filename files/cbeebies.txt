The Squirrels are playing outside in the snow and decide to build a jolly-looking snowman. But when the punky penguins turn up and poke fun at it, the competition REALLY hots up. The Squirrels make a snow slug, then the penguins make a snow bird. In the end, the very best thing they make is something they have all made together... an ENORMOUS snow slide!
