Duggee is working on an inventory of the clubhouse's supplies to plan for the future. The Squirrels wonder what the future is like - will Enid still be a cat? Could the clubhouse be in space? Luckily, Duggee has his Future Badge and many theories about the answers to their questions. The Squirrels are transported to a very different-looking future clubhouse, with a very different-sounding robot Duggee.
