Today, June 12
Joining Keith and Gail for today's GiggleQuiz are Captain Adorable and Dina Lady. Keith asks Dina Lady to play football with him, but Dina apologises, saying she needs to make a chocolate sandwich cake for today's winning team. Soon Dina ends up multitasking, showing off some impressive header skills whilst decorating her cake. The third round features a clip starring GiggleQuiz's own Keith Fitt, and he's confident the win is in the bag!
