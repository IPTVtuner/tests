Today, March 13
It's a windy day and Bing wants to fly his Hoppity Voosh kite with Flop. And he wants to do it all by himself. Even when Pando arrives and wants to help, Bing insists on doing it his way. When the kite gets caught up in the park bench, Bing realises that there are some times when another pair of hands comes in handy.
