Today, November 17
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the piece of seaweed and remembers the day she got it. Molly keeps asking Alice questions about the various items on her stall, and she is becoming annoying. Every question she asks reminds Alice of one her adventures around the world. Later, at the Wobbly Coffee Pot, Alice tells James how Molly's questions have made her feel nostalgic for her journeys around the world.
