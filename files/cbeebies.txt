The Squirrels are playing at the clubhouse when there is a knock at the door. It's delivery Chipmunk with a special delivery for Duggee and the Squirrels. Duggee opens the envelope and takes out the card inside: 'It is with very great pleasure that I invite Duggee and the Squirrels to my wedding.' King Tiger has met his perfect partner and is getting married. It's going to be a royal wedding!
