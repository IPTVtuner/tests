Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the golden hat and remembers the day she got it. Mrs Juniper signs Mack up for her talent show after Molly reveals he can play the sax. Mack is horrified, he hasn't played the saxophone for years. When he attempts to play, it sounds dreadful. Molly says he just needs a costume for confidence. Alice takes them to the vintage clothing stall and Mack tries on a golden hat.
