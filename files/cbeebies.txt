Small finds a strange looking object in space. He gives it to Mother as a present for her garden, an ornament. But this is more than an ornament as Mother is the first to discover. This ornament can memorise tunes it hears, Mother singing, and the singing flowers, Tiny's panpiping and even the music trees. And most amazingly, it plays them back together in perfect harmony. And the Clangers have a final surprise when it plays them musical sounds that they have never heard before!
