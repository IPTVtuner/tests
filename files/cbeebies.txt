Wizard Tripwick and Dina Lady join Gail and Keith for today's GiggleQuiz. Dina Lady is inspired to prepare one of her favourite dishes: potatoes with custard dip, a delicate juggle of flavours. Keith tells Dina Lady to leave the juggling to him and does his best to juggle potatoes. Arthur joins in with some impressive tricks, but Keith throws a potato up too high, coming back down to earth with a splat into Dina Lady's custard!
