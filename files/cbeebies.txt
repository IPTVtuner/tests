Today, January 19
Stripes and Toad see a beautiful sunrise and decide to write a song about it together, but Stripes wants the song to be rocky, while Toad wants it to be slower. When they fall out and go off to write their own songs separately, Yukee tries to help them become friends again and create one song together.
