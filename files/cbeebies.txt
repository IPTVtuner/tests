The children of Greendale have been practising for Karaoke Night and cannot wait for it to be time to sing. Everyone has a musical number prepared and they are ready to shake their stuff on the special stage that's been put up. The karaoke machine is pretty special too - it's solar powered but it turns itself on in Pat's van and all its charge is used up.
