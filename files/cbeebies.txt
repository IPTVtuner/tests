Aniyah is cooking a Brazilian national dish for us today: Feijoada, a stew containing black beans and lots of other delicious ingredients which is served with rice. Aniyah works hard to prepare all the ingredients, including squeezing her own fresh orange juice and tearing up cabbage leaves to go on top. Brazil is famous for its carnivals, so Aniyah's table is carnival themed, complete with bright, colourful headdresses for her friends to wear while they eat.
