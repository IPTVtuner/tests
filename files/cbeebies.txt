It's the start of a new day, and Wren has made a card for her best friend Emmy. Outside, Wren, Emmy and Ayat discover a ladybird, which soon flies away. They go in search of their new fluttery friend, but will they be able to find it? Later, it's Solomon's turn to sit at the VIP table as he has been doing so well at school, and he chooses Lusungu as his guest. Finally, Sophie has a fun activity for Wren, Solomon and Lusungu. They're going on a pretend train trip in search of dinosaurs.
