Mummy asks Topsy and Tim to sort their old toys. She wants the twins to give away the ones they don't use anymore before they move house. Tim doesn't want to give away any of his toys but when Mummy explains other children would love to play with them, he changes his mind and puts his old cars in the charity box. There's one car which Tim doesn't give away. He chooses to keep his favourite, old, flashing car until he hears about a younger boy who would love to have his toy.
