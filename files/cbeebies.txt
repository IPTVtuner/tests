Today, September 14
Joining Gail and Keith for today's GiggleQuiz are Captain Adorable and Dina Lady. Keen to make the most of their brain-boosting abilities, Gail produces a bowl of bananas. But the bananas are tricky to open, so Captain Adorable springs to the rescue; after quite a struggle he manages to break one in half. Later, Gail makes a grand entrance dressed as a Super Banana! Super Banana Gail hopes having two superheroes on the team will secure them a win.
