Professor Muddles demonstrates his latest invention, the Muddle Fit Ten Thousand. It helps him keep in shape by ensuring that he walks ten thousands steps a day, then gives him a cupcake reward. Keith Fitt is also keeping fit with another world record attempt: he's attempting to dance for three days and nights, but will he stay awake? Arthur Sleep is dancing too and tries to read the news whilst playing a game of musical statues with Doreen.
