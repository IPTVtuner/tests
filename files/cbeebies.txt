It is Granny's birthday and all the Clangers are planning their presents for her. Small asks Major Clanger if he can help him invent something for her but Major says his work is too difficult for such a young Clanger. Small decides to invent something himself, something which involves puffballs, airfruit and three extremely acrobatic - or should we say aerobatic - froglets.
