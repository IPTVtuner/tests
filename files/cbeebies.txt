Today, July 19
The circus has come to town and the Squirrels are very excited until they see that it is a flea circus. It is so tiny! It doesn't seem very impressive until they get to see some of the acts, like Fifi and her daring tightrope act, and the flea cannonball. The Squirrels are eager to get involved, especially when they see what the strong flea can do - now that's impressive!
