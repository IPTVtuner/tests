Kika is a golden Labrador and a guide dog for her owner Dr Amit, who is blind. She is trained to use her supersight to help him do as many things as he can by himself. Together, they make the best team. Kika needs to help Dr Amit catch a train to the city. First, they must walk to the station. Kika knows the way like the back of her paw, but there are some important things they must do along the way.
