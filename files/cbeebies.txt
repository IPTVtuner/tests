It's Christmas and everyone is getting ready for the pantomime. Little Lucy has a wonderful song to sing at the centre of the show, but when Pumpkin the horse gets spooked by the snow he runs off to find shelter! How will Lucy get back in time? A snowmobile saves the day and Pat gets Lucy back - in time for the panto and a rather special Christmas song to celebrate.
