Okai has invited his friends over for a traditional Ghanaian meal. Before they arrive, they have a taste of a very special ingredient, okra, which is also known as ladies fingers! Okai's friends don't really like the taste or texture very much, so he has to work very hard in the kitchen to make a tasty, colourful stew for them to enjoy. Okai also impresses his friends by wearing a brightly coloured Ghanaian shirt that matches his beautiful Ghanaian table decorations.
