Ryan's mum is Vietnamese and he is cooking a dish from Vietnam that she has taught him. He works hard in the kitchen mixing lots of ingredients together, including pork, prawns and fresh mint. He even finds time to teach us the Vietnamese word for egg! One of Ryan's ingredients is fresh mint, but not all of Ryan's friends like the taste or smell of it at first.
