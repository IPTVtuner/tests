It's lovely and warm - just right for a day on the beach. The squirrels learn how to make sandcastles - dig, dig, dig! They are doing such a good job that Jon and Nigel ask the crabs if the squirrels could work together to build them a new home. They create the most spectacular giant sandcastle ever seen, with shells, seaweed, great views and lots of sand.
