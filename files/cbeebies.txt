It's a very cold day on the Clangers' planet. So cold, that the Iron Chicken has to come down to the living cave to get warm! But when a Sky Moo wants to do the same, she finds the doors are frozen shut and she can't get in. Granny comes to the rescue with a clever plan to keep her and the other Sky Moos warm.
