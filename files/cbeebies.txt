Pando is teaching Bing and Sula how to do little kicks and big kicks with a ball in the garden. Sula does the biggest kick of them all, but Bing kicks the ball the wrong way. As he tries to kick it back to Pando it bounces off the shed, breaking Flop's window! They have to stand statue-still while Flop cleans up the glass.
