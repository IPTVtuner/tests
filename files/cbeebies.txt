Two teams touch down at the STARS space station to take on three scientific challenges to win out-of-this world prizes. First, they must work out if an object is heavier or lighter than another before placing it on a giant set of scales. Then the young scientists have to complete a huge fossil by digging for dinosaur parts in ball pits. Finally, the teams must make their way across a giant inflatable version of the solar system.
