Sienna's dad is from Nigeria and he has taught her a unique way of making Nigerian Jollof rice. Sienna asks her friends to try tasting fresh thyme, which is one of the ingredients in her Jollof rice, before they come round for a special Nigerian meal. No one is at all keen on the taste of the thyme, but Sienna is confident that she can change their minds when they try some of her food.
