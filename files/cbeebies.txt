Today, December 06
When Sam and David hear a distant piano on the estate, Kobi lends a hand to investigate. The trio find a ?lost? piano and are determined to reunite the instrument with its owner. Meanwhile Kobi tries to move the piano into their flat but there?s just no enough room and there?s not really enough room in his shed either. Sam and David?s investigation to find the piano?s owner looks like it might fail until Mrs Richards makes a brilliant suggestion.
