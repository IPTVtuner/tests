Bitz, Purl and Bob are on a treasure hunt on Faraway Island with the help of an old map, and they find a huge chest full of yummy chocolate coins. Unfortunately, Pirate Bevelbeard and his ship dudes Zip and Pop appear unexpectedly, grabbing the treasure and also Purl, and taking them back to their pirate ship. Bitz needs to work out how they can get aboard the ship and rescue Purl and the chocolate coins!
