Lola and Lotta both love their tricycles but when Lotta is given her big cousin's bike, Lola wants a big bike too, so she gets Charlie's old one and is delighted. When Lola gets to the park, she discovers that Lotta has taken her stabilisers off. Lola has to learn to ride without stabilisers too, and it's not as easy as it looks.
