It's the Big Beanbag Bash Day and Love Monster is very excited to throw some beanbags and win some games. Tiniest Fluffiest Bunny does better than he does, and Love Monster feels jealous of the attention that she gets. He becomes so frustrated that he kicks a beanbag and it hurtles towards the scoreboard, knocking all the points to the ground, ripping the bunting and giving Delivery Duckling, Elder Chick, Elder Panda and the In-Chicks a fright.
