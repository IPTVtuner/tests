Duggee and the squirrels decide to play football. Duggee starts the game by kicking the ball to the squirrels, who look at it blankly. They don't know what to do - they've never played football before. Worm, Hennie and Ethel do their best to show them the rules, but it's all going in the wrong direction. How will they ever score a goal?
