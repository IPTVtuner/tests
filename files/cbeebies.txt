Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the dog collar and remembers the day she got it. Mack buys Daisy a puppy called Little Mo, but Bob warns him that Moira has banned pets from the Hub. When the puppy starts to bark, Molly has an idea. She goes off to the pet stall to buy puppy food, but when she gets back to feed Little Mo, they find she has escaped. They search for Little Mo but they can't find her anywhere.
