Zak and Laila are thinking about what they could be when they are older. Laila's desires to be a builder creating wonderful buildings are questioned by Zak who worries that only boys can do the job. When Grandma Zainab intervenes, Zak and Laila end up taking a journey around the estate and realise that their preconceptions about boys and girl's jobs are wrong.
