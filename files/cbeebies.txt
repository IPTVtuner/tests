Today, October 31
Dee encourages a friend to say 'pumpkin', and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. There is an orange pumpkin, a bumpy pumpkin and a pumpkin with lots of seeds. The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's word.
