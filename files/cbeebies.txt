Today, December 31
Duggee masters his ambition of building a model of the Clubhouse out of sticks, so the Squirrels start to think about what their ambitions might be. Norrie wants to learn how to break dance. Happy has always wanted to jump the famous triple puddle splash. Betty has always wanted to teach Mr Cuddles how to speak Portuguese. Roly has loads, from growing a potato to becoming a pirate. Tag spends a long time thinking what his could be, and then it clicks - he needs to climb over the log!
