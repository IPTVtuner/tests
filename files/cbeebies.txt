Andy travels back in time 106 million years to the time of Muttaburrasaurus, a 9 metre long dinosaur that lived in Australia. His mission; to collect some red berries from a tree that the muttaburrasaurus liked to eat. They had funny bumps on the end of their noses which made spectaular noises - really useful to scare off a hungry allosaurus that comes their way!
