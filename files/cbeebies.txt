Choekyi has been shown a traditional way to make momos, which are a type of dumpling. First, Choekyi makes dough that is then rolled out into circles. She fills these circles with a mixture of spinach, cheese and mushrooms. When they tried mushrooms at first, Choekyi's friends did not really like the taste or smell. Let's hope they prefer them when they are cooked in the momos. Choekyi's recipe comes from Tibet, so when her friends arrive she greets them in a traditional Tibetan way.
