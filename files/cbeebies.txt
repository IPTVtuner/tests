Dee encourages a friend to say `cake' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. There is a small cake, a big cake, a banana cake and a carrot cake. There's a unicorn cake, a birthday cake and a wedding cake. Dee enjoys a wonderful rainbow coloured surprise cake and is a little worried by an upside down cake.
