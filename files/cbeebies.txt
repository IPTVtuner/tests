CBeebies
Today, November 02
Elder Kitten has a big announcement. He tells everyone that today is Elders Away Day, when the Council of Cuteness goes on holiday, and says they need a volunteer to lead Fluffytown. Eager Beaver puts her hand up and says that if she is picked, they will break the record for the most fun things done in one day. The Elders are impressed and Elder Kitten announces that Eager Beaver will be the leader for the day.
