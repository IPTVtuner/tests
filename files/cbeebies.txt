Today, December 22
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the wind-up torch and remembers the day she got it. The roof above Mack's stall is leaking. Molly suggests they have a sponsored sleepover to raise money to fix it. But just as the sleepover is about to start, Magnus tells Alice that he is afraid of the dark. Daisy sees Mack come in with a stuffed elephant called Mr Trunkton who helps Mack sleep at night.
