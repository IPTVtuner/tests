Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how woodpeckers play such an important role in the environment. They find out that woodpeckers love to eat insects, which helps keep nature in balance, and that some other birds recycle old woodpecker nests to make their own ones. On the way, they try making some woodpecker sounds and discover that green woodpeckers use their long tongues to find ants to eat.
