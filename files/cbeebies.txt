Today, September 28
Joining Gail and Keith for today's GiggleQuiz are Rapids Johnson and Professor Muddles. Always on the lookout for bears, Rapids tells Gail that the elusive Quizzly Bear might be in the studio, but in order to spot it they'll need camouflage. Gail rushes to her dressing room to fetch some plants, leaving an oblivious Rapids explaining the traits of a Quizzly Bear to the real Quizzly Bear! Later, Gail decides that she needs some more camouflage and adds another plant to her very full desk.
