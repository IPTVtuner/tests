Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the toilet roll frog and remembers the day she got it. Magnus is worried about his little brother Lennox joining the Kids Club, and he wants him to get on with everyone. Lennox isn't worried though - he just wants to talk about jungle animals. Molly is having some sibling problems of her own as Mack is too busy fixing toys to listen to her great ideas for his stall.
