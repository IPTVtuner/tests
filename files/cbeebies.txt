Today, January 31
Dee encourages a friend to say `chicken', and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. We see lots of chickens, a brown chicken, a white chicken, a clucking chicken and some friendly chickens. Dee meets a funky chicken, a hatching chicken and a cock-a-doodle-do-ing chicken! The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's word.
