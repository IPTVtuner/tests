Andy travels back in time 152 million years, to the time of Diplodocus - a massive 25 metre long plant eating dinosaur. His mission, to find and pick a giant fern to replace the one he accidentally broke back at the museum. Along the way he witnesses an adult diplodocus knocking down trees with its front legs. Will he succeed in time before the museum opens?
