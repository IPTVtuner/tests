Hearing dog Diesel is on an important mission, to wake his teenage owner Rayane, who's deaf, up in time for his football trial. There's a big match tomorrow, and Rayane really wants to be picked for the team. It's the summer holidays, so Rayane and Diesel have been sleeping in. Diesel needs to be on high alert! Diesel's superears are trained to alert Rayane to important sounds he might miss. Diesel is Rayane's ears.
