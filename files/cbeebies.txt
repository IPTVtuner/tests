Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how the tide plays such an important role in the environment. They find out that the tide usually goes in and out twice a day, which keeps our coasts full of life and helps bring food to lots of animals. On the way, they learn that the moon affects the tide, before exploring the beach and looking for tidal treasure.
