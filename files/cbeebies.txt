Two teams touch down at the STARS space station to take on three scientific challenges to win out-of-this world prizes. First, the teams must identify objects using just one of five senses. Then, the young scientists have to complete a huge fossil by digging for dinosaur parts in ball pits. Finally, the teams bounce around on trampolines to feel like astronauts experiencing low gravity on the moon. They must grab as many space objects hanging above them as they can before the time is up.
