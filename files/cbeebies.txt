On the menu is delicious tandoori chicken cooked in a traditional clay oven called a tandoor. Ria and Rohan use their grandma's special oven to make their version of this classic Indian dish. They cook chicken coated in a yoghurt sauce, which is spiced and full of flavour. They serve it to their friends alongside naan bread and yoghurt mint sauce.
