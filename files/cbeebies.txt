Kika and her family are off to the seaside. Since they'll be travelling by bus, she and Dr Amit will need to work together to find the way, using the map on Amit's phone and Kika's super sight. Once she learns a new route, she stores it in her memory bank. She knows 300 routes already - Kika is like a doggy GPS!
