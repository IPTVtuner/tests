A Sky Moo gives Small Clanger a strangely shaped little thing that it has found in space. None of the Clangers has a clue what it is. Small decides to give it to the Iron Chicken for her nest, but as she is flying back down in the Music Boat she sees a big thing with a strange piece missing in its side. Reuniting the little thing and the big thing has a very surprising result!
