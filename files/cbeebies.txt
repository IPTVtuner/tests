Cassava cake is a very popular dessert in the Philippines, so Reese is making a very special version for her friends to try when they come to visit. Reese's family come from the Philippines and this recipe is a family favourite. This is a cake that has lots of savoury ingredients such as cheddar cheese and cassava but also includes sweet flavours such as condensed milk and coconut cream.
