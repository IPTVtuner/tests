Today, December 07
Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the funny glasses and remembers the day she got them. It is story-reading day and Alice chooses Suki to read a story with her. Alice doesn't realise that Suki is shy and doesn't like reading in front of everyone. Suki decides to hide Alice's reading glasses so storytime will have to be cancelled.
