Today, June 26
Dee encourages a friend to say `umbrella', and goes on a whirlwind word adventure. See lots of different types of umbrella: rainy, sunny and even dancing ones. Dee and a friend have frog umbrellas, and even meet a Cinderella umbrella. The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's word.
