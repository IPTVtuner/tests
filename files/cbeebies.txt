Dan the border collie is a search and rescue dog who works with his owner Jamie. His super nose follows scents and smells so they can rescue people who need their help. A local artist is painting the view of Woofton from a hill. But when the wind gets too strong, he gets lost on his way down. Dan and Jamie are called to try to find him. Dan finds the artist's scent, leading him to his painting.
