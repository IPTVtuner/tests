A strange little egg-shaped creature lands on the planet - an Eggbot. It sings a high note - doh. It proceeds to explore and gets stuck in a cave deep underground, where it is heard by the sleeping Clangers. They are amazed when they hear another note, a low doh, and find a giant Eggbot come to rescue the little Doh, with the help of six other singing Eggbots - Ray, Me, Fah, Soh, Lah and Te!
