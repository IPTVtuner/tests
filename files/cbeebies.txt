Bing and Pando are both tired but insist on one last game of hide-and-seek before bed. Pando finds a great hiding place under the covers of Bing's bed but by the time Bing finds him he's fast asleep. Bing is tired too and gets upset when he thinks there's nowhere left for him to sleep, but Flop and Padget find a solution.
