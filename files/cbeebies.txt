Yakka Dee! celebrates children communicating - because talking fills you up with whizz, pop, bang! In this episode, Dee encourages a friend to say 'duck' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. We see lots of different ducks - a brown duck, a white duck and Dee even goes for a ride in a yellow duck boat! There are baby ducks, mother ducks and lots of funny ducks eating their dinner.
