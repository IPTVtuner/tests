Today's talented chef takes us to Mexico, cooking a traditional dish called enchiladas. Marina's dad has shown her how to make the recipe, which she really loves to eat. Marina grates, mixes and wraps up all her ingredients in tortilla bread and finishes with a squeeze of lime. Marina's friends taste the lime before they arrive, but they think it is a bit sour. Hopefully they will be impressed by her cooking and her special guest musicians: a traditional mariachi band.
