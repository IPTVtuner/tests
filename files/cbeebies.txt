Bing and Sula find a potato in Amma's vegetable patch with a comical face, so they take it under their wing, naming it Nosey. The two children look after Nosey and show him around the creche, but unfortunately Nosey goes down the slide too quickly and his nose falls off. Amma shows them how to plant both bits of potato so that they can grow new potatoes.
