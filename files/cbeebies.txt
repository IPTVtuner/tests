A meteor shower is about to hit the Clangers' planet. Major and Small shelter on the Iron Chicken's nest, while the others find cover in the living cave. But when the shower stops, they find that a giant meteor has fallen and blocked the double doors to the inside. With Major and Small not yet back, Mother, Granny and Tiny have to think of a way to remove the boulder themselves. They make their way to Major's workshop to see if they can invent a machine to help.
