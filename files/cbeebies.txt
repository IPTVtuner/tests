Today, July 17
Marian is making gyuveche today, and before his friends arrive they taste one of the main ingredients, feta cheese. They don't all like it at first, so let's hope they change their minds when they taste the finished dish. Marian works hard layering peppers, tomatoes and feta in beautiful Bulgarian pots. He then puts an egg on top of each one before it cooks in the oven. When his friends arrive, Marian is wearing traditional national dress and gives them all a traditional bracelet as a gift.
