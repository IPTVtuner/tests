Bing and Sula are performing a puppet show for Flop, Amma and Pando when Coco and Charlie arrive. Coco wants to join in with her Rainbow Fairy Mice. Sula tells a frustrated Bing that you have to be loud when you do a show. But Bing is a little too loud, and when Coco joins the show, Bing's loud Biteysaurus isn't welcome, as he is hurting Sula's ears!
