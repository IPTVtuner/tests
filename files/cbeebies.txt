It's autumn time. Jud, Jessica and their class visit a local park to collect leaves for an art project. Back at school, they use the leaves to create a huge leaf print picture - and things end up getting messy! The school playground is covered in leaves and the school caretaker, Mr Clever, needs help clearing them up. Luckily, he has a team of super leaf sweepers, who come to the rescue.
