Michael is organising restaurant night at school and all the children have been busy cooking and baking special dishes for everyone to come and eat. The tables are laid, the guests have arrived, there is just a slight problem - there are no plates or glasses! Pat is on his way with the crockery delivery but as he arrives he slips on a puddle the children have left and the plates are all broken.
