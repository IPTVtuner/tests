Hanna is cooking a very popular Japanese dish called sushi. Her recipe uses rice, which is one of the main crops from Japan. Hanna's special ingredient is Japanese seaweed called nori, which she uses to wrap up all of her colourful ingredients. Hanna and her friends eat the sushi with soy sauce after cleaning their hands with traditional hot towels.
