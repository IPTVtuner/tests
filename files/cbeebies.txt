Ameliya's family come from a country called Trinidad and Tobago, and today she is cooking a popular Trinidadian dish: pepper roti. Ameliya rolls out her dough into big circles before adding a very colourful filling of carrot, red pepper, cheese and her special ingredient, spinach. The roti are then rolled up into a cone, flattened and rolled out again before being cooked. Ameliya has a very special Trinidadian surprise for her friends while they eat, but will they enjoy her tasty spinach?
