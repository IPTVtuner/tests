It feels like an earthquake shakes the Clangers' planet. Major and Small go out to investigate. The music trees' notes have been shaken off, so Small puts them back on, before discovering what has happened to cause this - the eggbot has crashed onto the planet and is stuck in a crater. Meanwhile, Tiny discovers that the notes on the music trees are now in the wrong order. Small has an idea that if he can rescue the eggbot, the eggbot will be able to help get the notes back in the right order.
