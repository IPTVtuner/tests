Sam returns from visiting cousins to find poor Bella is feeling very down. Initially Sam can't understand why Bella would be so sad because it sounds like Bella and her friend Josie have had an amazing time. However, Bella reveals that Josie's family live on a barge and they are moving away. Sam and Eli must draw inspiration from Bella's Princess Blaize reading book to cheer Bella up and postwoman Doreen also delivers a well-timed surprise.
