Mrs Farrell and Miss Gerrard are having a Kindness Day at school, a time when the class shows how they can be extra kind to each other. As the children start their day, they are thinking of new ideas to be super-kind. Jessica and Orla draw lovely pictures for the teachers, which makes Mrs Farrell and Miss Gerrard feel happy. At lunchtime Solomon is finding the lid on his yogurt a bit tricky, so Sam helps him to open it!
