As the children arrive, there is a rainbow over the school. Mrs Farrell points it out to Bryn before they head inside to create their own rainbow on the carpet. The rainbow has disappeared and the rain has stopped, so some of the children go outside for a game of hide-and-seek in the forest area. They soon find a hammock and take it in turns to try it out whilst the others sing a nursery rhyme. Back inside, it's time for some more nursery rhymes with music teacher Miss Usher.
