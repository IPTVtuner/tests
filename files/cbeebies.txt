Talib is cooking a recipe that his mum has taught him, a colourful Tanzanian banana curry. After lots of chopping and mixing in the kitchen, Talib decorates a beautiful Tanzanian-themed table complete with gold animals. He also greets his friends with a greeting spoken in Swahili, a language spoken in Tanzania. Unripened bananas are an important ingredient in his curry, but not all of his friends are keen on the taste when they try it at first.
