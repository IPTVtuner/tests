Andy travels back in time 127 million years, to the time of Ornithocheirus - one of the largest flying pterosaurs that ever lived. His mission; to find the skeleton of a sand dollar - a sea creature which spent its life crawling around on the ocean floor. Along the way he comes nose to beak with a Tapejaras, a pterosaur which had a beautiful red crest, before taking to the skies on the back of an Ornithocheirus. But, will Andy succeed in time before the Museum opens?
