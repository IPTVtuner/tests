CBeebies
Today, September 27
Tinky Winky, Laa-Laa and Po laugh themselves silly with a funny joke but when they tell it to Dipsy, it doesn't tickle Dipsy in the same way. But Dipsy's funny dance does and when Dipsy dances again, the Teletubbies all laugh together. In Tummy Tales, children have fun being silly in a park.
