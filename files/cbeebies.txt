Molly examines her shelf of special things at the back of Mack's stall. She chooses the pony tag and remembers the day she got it. Mack is helping Daisy at the vet's surgery. He takes down the details of a caller whose pony needs injections and decides to fetch the pony himself. At the farm he meets Mrs Anderson, who says that her pony Twinkle is tied up around the corner. Mack walks Twinkle back to the vet's and goes inside to tell Daisy what he has done.
