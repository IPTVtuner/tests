While looking for things to sell in their shop, Bing and Sula find their old friend Mr Rainybow, but his head is completely gone. So they decide to sell him, and after a nice lady buys his stacky bit for her toilet rolls, they look for some more things to sell. But then they find Mr Rainybow's head and are sad that they can't get the rest of him back. However, Charlie loves to knock down Mr Rainybow's rings.
