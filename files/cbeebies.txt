Ranger Hamza and the Ramblers discover how stinging nettles play an important role in the environment. They find out that a nettle's sting can help protect it as well as some insects that shelter on them. They learn that nettles can also be food for some animals too. On the way, they try some nettle tea and pretend to be stinging nettles, trying to keep Ranger Hamza's Mr Fox away!
