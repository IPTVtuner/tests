CBeebies
Today, August 20
Dee encourages a friend to say 'u', and we go on an adventure around the sound. We go up, then underground, and meet an upbeat umbrella! The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's letter sound.
