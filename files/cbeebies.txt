Today, January 21
Nothing is going right for any of the Clangers today. Mother's new plant is drooping, Tiny's new tune doesn't sound very good, Granny's knitting colours clash, Major's rocket has broken down and Small's night light has run out of glow honey. But suddenly a wave of beautiful coloured light from a strange star passes over the planet and has a magical effect, everything changes for the better. All the Clangers are delighted until they notice that the star is fading away before their very eyes.
