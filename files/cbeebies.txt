Today, February 03
Dee encourages a friend to say `bag' and we go on a whirlwind word adventure. We see lots of different bags: a big bag, a tiny bag and a shiny bag. There's a sleeping bag, a beeping bag and even a leaping bag! The journey is repeated with some special surprises along the way, and everyone has a boogie when Dee's friend finally succeeds in saying today's word!
