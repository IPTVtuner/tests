Bitz has created a super strawberry, dreamy creamy, nicely icely, bake-a-licious cake that is so tasty Bob suggests she makes more so she can sell them to the whole world. They all start cake making in the jungle cafe, but with everyone trying to do the same job at the same time, the cakes end up looking very different. If Bitz wants to get her cakes looking the same and delivered to her customers on time, she needs to work out a proper system!
