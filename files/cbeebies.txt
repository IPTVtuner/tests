Maddie has an interview for her dream job: a tour guide at Shakespeare's Globe. She bursts on to the stage brimming with facts & information, but she needs to know that the theatre is about feelings too. William Shakespeare and his players put on a performance of Twelfth Night to help her understand. The story begins with twins Viola and Sebastian aboard a ship, but they sail into a storm and are shipwrecked.
