Sister-and-brother property developer team Scarlette and Stuart Douglas help Shammie and Norbert decide the future of their four-bed semi in Ipswich. The multi-generational household is at an impasse over whether to stay or go. Armed with £30,000, Stuart comes up with a masterplan to create a more sociable family space downstairs, while Scarlette has a healthy £350,000 budget to show them three homes in stunning locations.
