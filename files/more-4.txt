He's managed to dislocate his shoulder in such an unusual way that it takes a five-man team to pull Jim's shoulder back into place. Temi has a broken toe, having mistaken a concrete block for a football. Meanwhile, octogenarian James has a cyst on his knee, but is in so much pain that he's refusing treatment.
