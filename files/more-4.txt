Not to be outdone by the previous evening's entertainment, 27-year-old Polish croupier Tomasz Wisniewski hosts an `outrageous'-themed evening, giving plenty of scope for his guests' imaginations. Interpretations of the theme range from Bunny-Boy to giant toddler, and the night starts with a snoop around Tomasz' bedroom. At dinner, the starter and main are well received.
