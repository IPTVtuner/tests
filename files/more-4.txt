Bachelor Barry l'Anson is pulling out all the stops with a dinner party inspired by love, an unexpected choice of theme that shows the group a very different side to the guy they all think is a jack the lad. Dinner party purist Clair is not impressed, while posh vet James is equally concerned about Barry's `Splashes of Love' dessert. Will Barry have earned enough love from his guests to bag the Â£1,000 prize?
