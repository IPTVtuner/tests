This episode takes a moving - and sometimes light-hearted - look at when boys become men, and passing the baton between the generations. Twenty-six-year-old Nicholas has been punched in the face in a random attack. Meanwhile, Tyrell has damaged his big toe playing football, and Ho has brought his 78-year-old grandma Amoui to King's after finding her collapsed in her flat.
