The fourth host in Leeds this week is theatre technician Matt, who's planning to scoop the prize with a menu of tried and tested family favourites.

But neither hit the mark for IT director Andy, who declares it the worst night of the week so far and things go from bad to worse for Matt when Alice's dessert ends up on the floor.
