Staff nurse Sophie has moved from the Lancashire coast to work at King's College Hospital in south London, leaving her family behind for the first time. Her first patient today is 22-year-old chef James. He's come to King's after a stabbing, but in this case it was self-inflicted. Meanwhile, 83-year-old Ruby arrives with severe knee pain, accompanied by her worried daughter, Sarah.
