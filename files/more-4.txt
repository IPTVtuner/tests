Today, December 27
It's the final night in Darlington and the week is being rounded off with a `right royal knees up'. The host is Eseyoma, the self-proclaimed Queen of Sheba, and she's hoping that her Nigerian recipes, with an extra helping of glamour on the side, will be enough to convince her guests that she should win the Â£1,000. After a week of listening to her unique brand of honesty, Eseyoma's going to have to work hard.
