For 10 years, woodsman Ben Law fought for planning permission to build himself a house in the heart of the woods he worked. Ben wanted his home to be totally self-sufficient with no main services, and decided to build it using only materials from the woods, using techniques pretty similar to those used a thousand years ago. Kevin McCloud revisits Ben to discover how the house has grown to suit his family's needs.
