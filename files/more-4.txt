The first to host are exuberant Jon Shorrock and his wife Julia, who run the four-star B&B Derwent House in West Sussex. As the guests take a quiet gander at their rooms, Andy and Julian have concerns over their carpeted bathroom, worrying it could hide alien hair. Once they've settled in, Jon and Julia split the group up by gender for a glimpse of the local area.
