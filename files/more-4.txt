Nonagenarian Ernest was walking to get his pension when he was hit by a vehicle while crossing the road. He's rushed straight to resus, conscious but with injuries to his head and pelvis. On the same day, octogenarian William's finger is mangled and bleeding after he caught it on a machine at his metal working business. Later, 80-year-old Joyce and her son Kevin, who has learning difficulties, arrive after he collapses.
