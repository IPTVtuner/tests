It's the first day of the competition in Worcestershire and fitness enthusiast Claire Wier is producing a low-fat menu for her guests, Tim, Teresa, Chris, and Pippa. Claire remains confident and oblivious all evening, despite her guests moaning about the lack of cream, fat, oil and butter in her meal. As if healthy eating wasn't enough, Claire has her guests working up their appetite with an aerobic workout.
