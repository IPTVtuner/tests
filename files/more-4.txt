The third visit of the week is to The Crown at Whitchurch in Herefordshire, where ex-army man Tom Jones runs the pub B&B with his step-daughter Samara Cohen. Initial impressions are good as Martin and Hannah struggle to find fault and Clare and Fran feel like queens. But, still smarting following their feedback, Rob and Michelle have a fair few gripes. During an afternoon racing an army-style assault course the competitiveness within the group is clear.
