The group are off to Great Yarmouth to stay in Sue's dog friendly Seashells Guesthouse. After revealing that she allows dogs to sleep in the beds during the last B&B visit, no one knows quite what to expect. As soon as they pull up, all the guests are blown away by the doggy-themed exterior. The interior is equally memorable, with Paul and Flora finding themselves in the Cappuccino Room and Caroline in the Poppy Room.
