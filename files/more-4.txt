The final visit of the week is to Robert and Kerstin's establishment Westleigh Farm, in Somerset. Upon inspecting the rooms Danny finds dust and cobwebs and some wrong hangers, but there's praise elsewhere as Debbie comments on how big the showers are and John and Pat run some successful milk tests. Later, there's a beekeeping lesson and snooker, and some generous helpings for breakfast.
