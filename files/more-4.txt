Michael Buerk follows the heir hunters as they take on a very valuable estate. Alexander Gibb left behind not one, but two valuable properties and the search for heirs uncovers great country estates and a history of landed gentry. Whilst on the case of Robert Heavens, the heir hunters have to start their search again when certificates come into the office and reveal a surprising family secret and the discovery of long lost family members.
