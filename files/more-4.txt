The final visit is to The New Court Hotel in Usk, where manager Clare Davies is joined in the competition by the pub owner's mother, Fran Hancock. On arrival, Tom and Samara are impressed, but Martin and Hannah find lots of cleanliness issues. At dinner, there are tensions as the group discuss who would take which role if they were to run a B&B together. Breakfast is cooked by Clare, but peppery eggs and missing mushrooms cause concern.
