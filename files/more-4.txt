The first day of this new competition is at the Blackthorn Farm B&B on Anglesey, Wales, where best pals Richard Tuke and Susan Hatch hope to be crowned best value B&B of the week. On arrival, Dan and Rachel Lonergan take in the view, and Malcolm and Fiona Piers-Taylor are feeling the vibes for their morning meditation.
