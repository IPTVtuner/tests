Today, December 18
It's the turn of Deborah Morrison and Wayne Bingham to host at their B&B, Braddon Hall in Torquay. Melvyn and Sindy are curious to know if the B&B's chandelier's sturdy enough to do some swinging from, but find their four poster bed a little squeaky. Gill and Pete are concerned over the mismatching type-faces in the in-room brochure, which is apparently a cardinal B&B sin.
