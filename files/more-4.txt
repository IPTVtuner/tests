This episode focuses on patients whose illnesses prove tricky to diagnose. Nine-year-old Tino is rushed to resus after slumping over her desk at school. Usually a lively young girl, she can't remember what day it is or her surname. She doesn't even recognise her own mum. Treating Tino is consultant Liz, but despite her years of experience, even she isn't initially certain what's wrong with Tino.
