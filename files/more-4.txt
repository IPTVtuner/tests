The team seek the heirs of Gordon Clarke, who died in 2009 aged 65. Gordon was a pen maker by trade, working in Birmingham's jewellery quarter, and the heir hunters need to find out if rumours of an estate worth Â£40,000 are true. Plus, investigations into the case of Jack Thornton reveal some unusual family names which turn out to have a surprising pedigree. Plus details of three more unclaimed estates.
