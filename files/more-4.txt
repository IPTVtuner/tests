The first to host is Mrs Tee of Gorse Meadow, a four star B&B in the New Forest. Her eccentric personality charms the guests on arrival but not everyone's room is up to scratch. John and Neil's bathroom window needs fixing and Alistair and Emma Mundell find they are sharing their room with ladybirds, cobwebs and dust.
