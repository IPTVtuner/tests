Hosts at Ombersley Bed & Breakfast are village bakers Diane and Max Seivewright. On arrival, Ann and Bill conduct a dust hunt in their room. Jan and William are left speechless by the outdated rooms, and Galia finds the journey across the hall for conveniences, inconvenient. Galia and Ann bicker over gluten-free bread and hand washing, and Ann is underwhelmed by her eggs at breakfast and later she finds herself in tears.
