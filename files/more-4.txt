The final B&B of the week is Annette McAnespie's Hazelwood Farm in Crake, Yorkshire. Annette is a one woman whirlwind, as she cleans and cooks everything herself in her four-star silver B&B and also provides extra touches such as homemade biscuits in each room. Most initial impressions are favourable. After settling in, hyperactive Annette has lined up her idea of fun for her guests: a cycling tour.
