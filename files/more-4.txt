Today, December 31
It's day two in the competition and the turn of cat-lover Eileen Finn to cater for her B&B competitors at the four-star Thornley House in Allendale, Northumbria. After being blown away by first hosts Simon and Shirley at the luxury Old Hall Country House, Eileen has her work cut out. Also, Eileen's beloved and very large Maine Coon cats are not to all of her guests' liking.
