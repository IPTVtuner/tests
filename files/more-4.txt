The first visit is to the Bridge Hotel in Scunthorpe with new owners Martin and Hannah Weaver. On arrival, Rob and Michelle Earp from Seashells B&B in Sutton-on-Sea find a condom by the entrance, and Clare Davies and Fran Hancock from The New Court Hotel in Usk have concerns over interior cleanliness. Tom Jones and Samara Cohen from The Crown at Whitchurch judge the rooms to be little more than functional.
