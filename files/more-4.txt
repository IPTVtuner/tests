For the final visit the group checks into the boutique B&B Urban Beach in Bournemouth - run by local entrepreneur Mark Crib. With top prices of Â£170, the chic rooms come with all mod cons and super deluxe bathrooms. The afternoon's activity is a speedboat ride along the Jurassic coast. All the guests approve - even Mrs Tee is full of praise.
