It's the penultimate night of the competition in Southend and all eyes are on barmaid and self confessed airhead Steph Barrett as she hosts a dinner party in the hope of winning the Â£1,000 prize. The day gets off to a disastrous start as Steph attempts to make pastry for the very first time with hilarious results. Things get back on track after an emergency visit from her Nan who brings round some ready-made pastry.
