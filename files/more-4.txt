Kendari the babirusa (a sort of pig-deer from Indonesia) is pregnant. But the two short-clawed otters she shares a paddock with, Wallace and Annie, keep throwing stones at her house while she's settling down to give birth. Keepers decide to move Wallace and Annie out of the babirusa paddock and into the habitat next door, where the Bornean orangutans live.
