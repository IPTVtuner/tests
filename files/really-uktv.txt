The second heat begins. Another group of amateur designers will compete across three knock-out rounds for one place in the quarter-final. They are engineering manager Rob, DIY store worker Angelica, ex-visual merchandiser Sarah and textiles lecturer Lucy. They're in the beautiful thatched village of Briantspuddle in Dorset - an unusual Edwardian experiment that presenter and architectural historian Tom Dyckhoff takes a closer look at.
