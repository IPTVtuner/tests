Really
Today, March 13
James Braxton and Charlie Ross are shopping their way from Buckinghamshire to the Cotswolds. Charlie buys something he acknowledges as "ghastly" and James makes a purchase purely on his sense of smell. But will these strange strategies pay off at the auction? On the way they take a trip along the towpath of the Grand Union Canal and also find out about the incredible work of the code-breakers of World War One, before heading to auction at Wotton-under-Edge.
