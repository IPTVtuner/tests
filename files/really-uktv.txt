Really
Today, December 13
Upcycling supremo Sarah Moore scours the skips at Witley Recycling Centre in Surrey, hoping to find three unwanted items she can restore, rejuvenate and sell on for a profit. Assisting Sarah in her mission are trusty artisans Neil Wragg and Simion Hawtin-Smith. A pair of leather wallets are given a magic makeover by bag maker Neil, while upholsterer Simion has the task of transforming a rocking chair. A collection of oak off-cuts will be given the upcycling once-over by Sarah.
