Really
Today, August 30
Upcycling authority Sarah Moore rummage through the rubbish at Woking recycling centre. Having saved three items from the skips, she calls in some crafty creatives to help her turn them into profit. While master craftsman Bruce Faulseit is faced with an antique desk, lighting designer Duncan McKean has an interesting challenge on his hands with two barley twist chairs. Sarah has some grooming sets to overhaul, but will she succeed in finding new homes for all three of her upcycled items?
