Today, May 30
In Altrincham in Greater Manchester, Jay Blades is scouring the recycling centre in search of three unwanted items to save and sell on. Designer Sarah Peterson attempts to give an old table a new lease of life, while clockmaker Paul Parry has an interesting challenge on his hands with a redundant record player. For his own project, Jay has a farmhouse chair to overhaul, but will he succeed in finding new homes for all three upcycled items?
