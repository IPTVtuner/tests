Really
Today, February 20
It's the fourth leg of the trip for antiques dealer Margie Cooper and auctioneer Natasha Raskin Sharp, and Lancashire is their destination. Natasha ends up on two wheels and resorts to pedal power, while Margie swaps the 1960s convertible classic car for an 80-year-old fire engine. In a break from shopping, Natasha explores an underground world hidden beneath a suburb of Liverpool and tries to find out why it exists.
