Really
Today, March 10
Catherine Southon and Philip Serrell continue their antique adventure in a classic Citroen. In Winchester Catherine finds a jolly nice croquet set, and in Alton a rare 1930's novelty biscuit tin, both of which give her a chance of huge profits at auction in Christchurch. Meanwhile, Phil learns how flying boats gave us the word `airport'.
