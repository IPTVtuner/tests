Really
Today, April 22
The final bend in the road on this Scottish sojourn sees antiquers Mark Hill and Roo Irvine bombing around the back lanes of the Isle of Skye in a 1970s classic car. Roo meets the chieftain of a highland clan with a magical weapon to protect him against invaders, while Mark travels to Loch Katrine to learn about one of Scotland's most famous sons. The buys are sweet for Roo, who purchases a bonbon dish and a pretty Victorian brooch.
