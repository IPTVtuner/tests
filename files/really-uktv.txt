Really
Today, January 10
Soft toy restorers, Amanda Middleditch and Julie Tatchell take two well-worn teddy bears under their wing. Big Ted and Little Ted have spent nearly a lifetime together, their childhood owners, Jill and Edwin, met as teenagers, fell in love, married at 23 and spent the next forty years together until Edwin death four years ago. Now Amanda and Julie must restore the well-loved bears, to reverse the years of wear and preserve the happy memories of a lifetime of love.
