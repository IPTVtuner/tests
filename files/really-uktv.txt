Really
Today, January 15
The ever-reliable Morris Minor takes Margie and Paul from Chesterfield to auction in Leicester. On the way Paul gets excited about bus conductors while Margie sweetens the deal with a very peculiar honey separator. Paul's vast knowledge of militaria helps him uncover an unusual collectible from the First World War, though it's questionable whether anyone in the saleroom will know what it is. Also, Margie hopes a gruesome find will attract big bids.
