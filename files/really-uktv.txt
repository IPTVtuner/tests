Really
Today, April 01
James Braxton and Charles Hanson are road tripping south from Glasgow, shopping in Ayrshire and Lanarkshire before selling at an auction in Hamilton. James is bowled over when he sees an arts and crafts oak table while Charles is knocked for six after finding some rare 2,000 year old Roman nails excavated in Scotland. James stops in Ardeer to hear why the local beach is connected to the Nobel Peace Prize and Charles stops off to hear about a local man who became a pioneering social reformer.
