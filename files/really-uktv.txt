Really
Today, January 12
It's the end of the tour for Natasha Raskin Sharp and James Braxton as they pilot their Porsche towards Oxfordshire and their final chance to shine. With money in their pockets and a renewed sense of purpose, the competition is heating up. As they hit the shops, Natasha finds it hard to adjust to a healthier budget. James finds himself in shed heaven as he sidesteps his way through a series of outbuildings chock full of antique furniture.
