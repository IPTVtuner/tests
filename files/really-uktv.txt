Really
Today, March 15
On the final leg of this Caledonian caper, auctioneer Izzie Balmer and dealer David Harper hit the Highlands proper. These antiques experts will be pootling along both the high and low roads of north east Scotland in this final, nail-biting episode. While shopping, David falls under the stare of a man from 1860, but jewellery expert Izzie plays it safe and picks up something sparkly.
