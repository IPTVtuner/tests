Really
Today, December 26
Auction supremo Christina Trevanion and woodworking wizard Will Kirk point their little blue van to Shropshire. They've been called in to help couple Sue and Chris clear their house as they make the move of a lifetime. After a decade of grief following the tragic death of their teenage son Matthew in 2012, Sue and Chris have finally decided it's time to move on. They're swapping their rural surroundings for something sunnier down south.
