Really
Today, September 22
Sarah Moore is at Woking Recycling Centre in Surrey searching for tired and unwanted items she can transform from skip-bound to stylish. With three items saved, Sarah turns to upholsterer Sharon O'Connor to overhaul an old chair frame, while upcycler Jacqui Joseph attempts to transform a dated desk. Sarah's challenge is to update a set of four chairs, but will her eclectic items prove to be too past-it to make a profit?
