Really
Today, April 21
A new road trip, a new classic car and a brand new expert: dealer and auctioneer Mark Hill joins veteran antique-seeker Roo Irvine on a hunt for collectables and curios around Scotland. Mark goes about parting with his Â£200 kitty with gusto, buying 1940s ceramics, a ship in a dome and a 1920s French fountain pen that really is something to write home about. However, one discovery he secures for a bargain price proves to be a canny investment when it soars at auction.
