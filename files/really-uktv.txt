Today, July 30
In Surrey, Sarah Moore scours bootfuls of rubbish at Woking Recycling Centre in the hope of finding some gems among the junk. There are some retro kitchen cupboards in need of attention from designer Rupert Blanchard, some old garden gates are reborn thanks to married metal workers Bex Simon and Dave Harris, and Sarah sets to work on a sideboard with matching chairs.
