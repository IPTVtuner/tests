Really
Today, April 03
The third leg of this antiques odyssey with Catherine Southon and Philip Serrell has them pootling the old Citroen through the West Country. Catherine decides to change her buying strategy, going for more of Philip's rust-and-woodworm fare. True to form, Phil diverts to the beach and asks a local fisherman if he has some antique chandlery to sell!
