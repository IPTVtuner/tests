Really
Today, February 26
It's the last outing for the travelling twosome, Serhat Ahmet and Christina Trevanion, on a whistle-stop tour around south Wales. They battle each other and the elements as `Storm Christina' hits, so it's roof-up time in the Porsche and, as Serhat takes to two wheels, time to pop on a poncho. There's a mad dash around the shops for our two as Serhat tries to eke out his tiny budget, while Christina struggles to blow all of her money.
