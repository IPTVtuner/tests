At the recycling centre in Walsall, upcycling aficionado Jay Blades unearths three hidden gems with profit-making potential. To help transform his trash Jay turns to upholsterer Simion Hawtin-Smith to rejuvenate two metal chairs, while furniture restyler Chloe Kempster is challenged to come up with a radical redesign for a loom chair and cabinet. Unwanted wardrobe doors are Jay's own creative project, but will the transformations ensure he can return a profit to the items' unsuspecting owners.
