Today, January 14
Jacqui Joseph is at Earlswood recycling centre in Surrey in search of tired and unwanted items that she can transform from skip-bound to stylish. With three items saved, Jacqui turns to designer Sarah Peterson to transform four dining chairs, while woodworking wizard Bruce has a pair of wardrobe doors to contend with. For her own project, Jacqui's creativity is tested by a retro cabinet, but will all three transformations pack a profit?
