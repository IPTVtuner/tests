Really
Today, December 26
Christina Trevanion and Will Kirk head to Buckinghamshire to help a mother and daughter who are overrun with antiques and unwanted objects. The storage space in Sarah and Georgie's house is full of items of stock left over from Sarah's late father's antiques business, and they don't know what to do with it all. The task for our experts is to work out what it's all worth. Auctioneer Christina finds a cache of very fine timepieces and learns about Sarah's dad's profession as a watch repairer.
