Today, March 14
Alistair Appleton is in Devon helping a couple of journalists to find a characterful country home with holiday let potential. They have a generous property budget of Â£700,000 with which to make the move. While in the county, Alistair meets a pioneering young sheep farmer and gets a masterclass in hand shearing the grey-faced Dartmoor sheep.
