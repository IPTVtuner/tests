Really
Today, December 11
Reclamation master Jay Blades is at a recycling centre in Altrincham in search of three skip-bound items he can rework and repurpose. Jay enlists two magnificent makers in his plight to turn trash into cash: woodworking wonder Ollie Allen is on hand to give a coffee table a new look, and upcycler Jacqui Joseph attempts a creative makeover on a set of dining chairs. For his own project, Jay has a glass demijohn to work on, but will all three makeovers be a success?
