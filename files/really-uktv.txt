Today, November 22
Anita Manning's historic big win at the last auction is proving a sticky wicket for Raj Bisram, who's keen to avoid the wooden spoon. Still, on his home turf in Kent hope springs eternal as he learns about WW2's Operation Dynamo and the `Dunkirk spirit'. Meanwhile, Anita pops to Canterbury to uncover the story behind the bloody murder of Thomas Becket at the cathedral. Raj finds his own little Buddha, but will this one sell for thousands of pounds too?
