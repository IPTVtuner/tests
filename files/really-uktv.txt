Really
Today, February 23
Serhat Ahmet and Christina Trevanion travel north to south down the backbone of England, from Sheffield to Coventry, one by Land Rover and one by Speedster. This time out, the pair decide to push their boundaries. Porcelain dealer Serhat turns his back on his usual pots and goes in search of shinier things. Jewellery aficionado Christina tries to steer clear of sparkly items and almost succeeds.
