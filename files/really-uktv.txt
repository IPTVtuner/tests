Upcycling entrepreneur EJ Osborne is at Llanfoist Recycling Centre in Monmouthshire where he's searching the boots for potential loot. Assisting EJ in his mission to rescue, revamp and re-home three pieces of skip-bound trash treasure are lighting expert Guy Trench and carpenter Ollie Allen. Guy will attempt to light up a collection of dusty wine bottles while Ollie is tasked with repurposing an old wooden door.
