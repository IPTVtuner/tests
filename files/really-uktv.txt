Really
Today, September 19
Jay Blades is rummaging through the rubbish at Walsall Recycling Centre, where he is on the lookout for three unwanted items he can save from the skip. Jay calls on designer Sarah Peterson to give a pair of chairs a modern twist, while carpenter Bruce Faulseit is tasked with repurposing a collection of metal racks and drawers. For his own project, Jay has a school desk to contend with, but will he succeed in giving all three cast-offs a new lease of life?
