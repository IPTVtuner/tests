Really
Today, August 01
It's the third leg of the antiques odyssey of dealer Margie Cooper and auctioneer Natasha Raskin Sharp. Touring around the Lake District, Natasha is behind the wheel of the smooth and sassy 1960s Mercedes motor, while Margie ends up on a pushbike. Natasha discovers a musical secret hidden in the shadow of Skiddaw, while for Margie it's the very essence of the Lake District, the freshwater upon which it thrives, that takes centre stage.
