Today, February 27
Eloise McKenna from Kent brings in what could be the trickiest restoration yet for ceramics expert Kirsten Ramsay. The large alabaster light shade belongs to Eloise's sister and was smashed to smithereens in an unfortunate accident. Kirsten has a giant puzzle on her hands and she must call on all of her experience and patience to piece it back together again.
