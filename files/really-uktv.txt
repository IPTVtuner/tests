Really
Today, December 05
Davina McCall and Nicky Campbell present a series which aims to reunite family members after years of separation. Growing up in Northern Ireland in the late 1970s, Wendy O'Hagan was seven before she learned about her real father. Her mother had fallen in love with American serviceman Grant Williams, but Grant was suspected of being a Republican sympathiser, and was eventually deported.
