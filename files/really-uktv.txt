Today, May 30
Alistair Appleton is in the Cornish countryside house hunting with a couple planning an escape from the busy suburbs of Surrey, and with their Â£350,000 budget would like to move their family of five to rural Cornwall. Alistair also heads to West Cornwall's rugged coast and courageously joins a team of passionate seaweed collectors to dive and harvest this edible, sustainable superfood.
