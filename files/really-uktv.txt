`The Great British Sewing Bee', presented by Claudia Winkleman, returns for a fourth series. The show features ten hopefuls tested on their needle skills as they compete to be crowned Britain's best amateur sewer. Presiding over the contest are the judges, Savile Row tailor Patrick Grant and newcomer Esme Young from Central St Martins. Contestants are set three sewing challenges, on which they will be judged on personal style as well as technique. The best performers get through each week while those at the bottom are eliminated from the competition.
