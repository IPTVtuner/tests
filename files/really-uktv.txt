Really
Today, October 03
Auctioneer Natasha Raskin Sharp and ceramics expert Steven Moore are on a whistle-stop tour of Tyne and Wear before wandering north to Northumberland. Natasha wastes little time in the antiques shops, gambling her kitty like an 18th-century taverngoer buying some George III period gaming tokens. She ditches the 1960s Rolls Royce and sets off on a very unlikely safari to catch sight of an ancient creature that still roams the Northumberland plains.
