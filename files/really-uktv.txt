Really
Today, February 26
Sarah Moore is in Somerset, leaving no stone unturned at Keynsham Recycling Centre. Her mission is to save three items, have them transformed or revitalised before trying to sell them for a profit. She has her sights set on an oak serving table, there's a glass splashback for screen print designer Zoe Murphy to work on, and upholsterer Simion Hawtin-Smith attempts to breathe new life into a very old armchair.
