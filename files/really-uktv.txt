Really
Today, November 06
It's a brand new road trip for Philip Serrell and Catherine Southon. Setting off from the Midlands in a 1970 Citroen DS20, they hunt for antiques in Birmingham and Stratford-upon-Avon, heading for a far from humdrum auction in Salisbury. Phil spends a lot of his cash on a 19th-century butter churn, whereas Catherine finds two attractive 1940s compacts.
