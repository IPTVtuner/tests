Really
Today, March 31
Philip Serrell is joined by Louise Gostelow, travelling around the east of England. Phil fishes out some distinctly coastal clobber while Louise sticks with the nautical theme and buys a little yacht. Along the way Louise learns the little-known reason why piers exist, and Phil hears the story of a brave fisherman's contribution to the war effort.
