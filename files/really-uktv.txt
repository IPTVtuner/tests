As the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic grips the entire country, the pressure mounts on the NHS in the north west. Twenty per cent of staff are off due to Covid, and if demand continues to increase, emergency plans will need to be implemented to enable the remaining staff to cope. Merseyside's four major hospitals are currently at 95 per cent capacity, and in just the last 24 hours there have been over 1,000 new emergency calls related to Covid.
