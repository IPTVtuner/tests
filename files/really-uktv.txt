Really
Today, May 25
Joselyn Turner was born profoundly deaf and put in a children's home at only two weeks old. She knows that her birth mother also had a son and is now searching for her older brother James for answers to her lifelong questions. In turn, James has also been searching for the father he never knew, and after 73 years, James finds more family than he bargained for.
