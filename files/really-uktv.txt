Really
Today, November 21
Sarah Moore is rummaging the rubbish at Wallyford Recycling Centre in East Lothian. With three items saved from the skip, Sarah turns to upcycler extraordinaire Rupert Blanchard to transform a wooden clothes airer while blacksmith Kev Paxton takes on piano frame. For her own project, Sarah attempts to make over a modern fire surround.
