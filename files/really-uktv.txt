Today, April 04
In Surrey, upcycling expert Sarah Moore is on guard at Witley Recycling Centre hoping to discover unwanted items that can be revamped and sold on for profit. Sarah enlists the help of leather crafter Uzo Okwuosa and furniture artist Chloe Kempster to reinvent a broken horse saddle and reins and to revitalise a mid-century set of drawers. Sarah tries to cultivate something sellable from some ancient rotovator blades.
