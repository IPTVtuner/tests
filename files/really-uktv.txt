Really
Today, February 25
We begin a brand new road trip with antiques experts Anita Manning and Raj Bisram. Each armed with Â£200, they're taking a 1973 Triumph Spitfire on a B road romp around East Anglia hunting for treasures to take to auction in Beeston, Norfolk. Along the way Anita uncovers the little-known story about a local hero, anti-slavery campaigner Thomas Clarkson and Raj hears about an agricultural pioneer at the stunning Holkham Hall.
