Really
Today, June 17
We catch up with three searchers who came to us desperate to find their parents. John Hacking was reunited with his birth mother Maureen after 50 years. Maureen herself grew up in care and after finally meeting her son, it prompted her to search for her own birth family. Pearse Egan met his father in 2018, but that's not the end of the story. Pearse is in London to meet his older brother Nick for the first time. Our final story follows sisters Anne Jordan and Flo Banfield who first met in 2019.
