Really
Today, May 13
We catch up with two families who have been transformed in ways they could never have imagined. When 55-year-old Julie Roberts happily reunited with her birth mother Marion Quigley last year, she unravelled a difficult family history which sparked an extraordinary chain of events. Now Marion wants to track down her two other children who were also taken into care. In our second story, we catch up with 28-year-old Christina Barlow who found her birth mother in Colombia.
