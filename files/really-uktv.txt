Really
Today, April 03
Jacqui's in Surrey leaving no stone unturned at the Earlswood Recycling Centre searching for three items she hopes can be revived and sold on for a profit. There's an oil heater that's on the brink of being binned, a pair of patterned armchairs and a homemade dollhouse. Upholsterer Leigh-Anne Treadwell and blacksmith Kev Paxton set to work helping Jacqui transform her finds.
