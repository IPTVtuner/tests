Really
Today, February 22
It's a brand new trip and there's a brand new expert. The newbie is London-based porcelain dealer Serhat Ahmet, who joins a doyenne of the road trip, Christina Trevanion, for a jaunt around the antiques emporia of Wales and the Midlands. They kick off in north Wales in their rather glamorous Porsche Speedster. It's all uncharted territory for Serhat as he gets his hands on a conveyance for dollies and one piece of pottery that has Christina a little jealous.
