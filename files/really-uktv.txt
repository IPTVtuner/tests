Really
Today, August 22
At Woking recycling centre in Surrey, upcycler extraordinaire Sarah Moore is on the lookout for three unloved items that she can save and sell on for a profit. To help transform her trio of skip-finds, Sarah turns to upholsterer Simion Hawtin-Smith to give a little green chair a new lease of life, while furniture restorer Katie Keat has a dated display cabinet to contend with. For her own project, Sarah tries to turn a profit on a pair of school chairs.
