Really
Today, November 01
A brand new road tripping adventure for Charles Hanson and James Braxton. Behind the wheel of a 1964 German DKW 1000 Coupe, the hunt for antiques starts in the Scottish Highlands. James is drawn to a jolly filthy yet well made kilim rug and Charles uncovers some Jacobite period copper ladles. James rests from shopping to hear about Bonnie Prince Charlie's defeat at Culloden.
