Really
Today, December 31
Embarking on the fourth leg of their road trip, James Braxton and Irita Marriott rummage through antiques shops across Wiltshire and Dorset. James goes on a journey back to the land before time where he meets a famous fossil hunter. Irita takes a break from shopping to visit the site of the once-great Shaftesbury Abbey.
