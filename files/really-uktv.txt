Today, January 08
Charlie and James present a Somerset Special: from Glastonbury to Frome by way of Exmoor, they enjoy the wonderful West Country and acquire several antiques along the way. James hopes an antibacterial purchase will see him clean up at auction whereas Charlie's novel approach to get a discount sees him invite a dealer to join him for Christmas dinner, so long as she brings her Edwardian silver candlesticks. They also take in a visit to a glorious gothic cathedral in Wells.
