A humdinger of an episode sees Anita Manning and Raj Bisram hit the road for the penultimate time.

The gorgeous Kent towns of Deal, Sandwich and Faversham host our twosome for shopping but Anita learns about Whitstable Oysters and Raj detours to hear how thousands of boys became Naval officers in the area.
