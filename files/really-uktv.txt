First in to see mechanical expert Steve Fletcher is Suzanne Richeux from London. She brings an enchanting trinket belonging to her late mother, who was a world-famous trapeze artist. The decorative cage contains ornamental birds that, when wound up, would sing and flutter. Suzanne remembers being mesmerized by it when her mother wound it for her and her sister at bedtime most evenings.
