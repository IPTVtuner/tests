Upcycling supremo Sarah Moore is in Woking, exploring the recycling centre for discarded items that can be given a new lease of life. She finds a small set of drawers, a gentleman's wardrobe and four lawn chairs that haven't seen the sun for years. With the help of print artist Zoe Murphy and designer Lucy Tiffney, Sarah's three items are transformed.
