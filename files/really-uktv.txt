Really
Today, July 12
Auctioneer Charles Hanson and fellow gavel basher James Braxton are back on the road, navigating their way around Kent in a 1950s MG and a 1960s Austin Healey. Expect fruit, lots of fruit! Well, it is the Garden of England after all. Plus, in Gillingham, the restored paddle steamer they call the Heroine of Dunkirk. Our treasure seekers remain true to form, with 'Bamboo Braxton' finding an unusual Japanese artefact made from just that material.
