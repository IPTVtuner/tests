Really
Today, May 21
Sarah Moore leaves no stone unturned at Keynsham Recycling Centre in Somerset as she searches for gems that can be transformed and sold on for profit. She discovers the iron base from a garden table and sets blacksmith Kev Paxton to work on it. There's also a small tub chair that Leigh-Anne Treadwell raises to new heights, and Sarah rings in the changes for an old wooden till box in the hope of turning a profit for its original owner.
