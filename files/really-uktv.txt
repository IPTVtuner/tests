Really
Today, December 26
`Death in Paradise' star Ralf Little leaves the sun-drenched Caribbean well behind as he heads to the Orkney Islands off the north coast of Scotland to investigate his grandfather Arthur's experiences during the Second World War. Ralf is astonished to discover that Arthur was caught up in one of the most important battles of the war. Looking into another branch of his family, Ralf is thrilled to confirm a family rumour that he has a Welsh international footballer on his family tree.
