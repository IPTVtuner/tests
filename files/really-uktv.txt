Really
Today, December 25
Margie Cooper and Paul Martin head for Plymouth on the final leg of their journey. The competition has tightened, and only a few pounds separate the rivals. Along the way, Margie hears the story of a footballer, once forgotten but finally being given the recognition he deserves. And Paul is all at sea discovering the tale of a lighthouse, built in the 18th century, that became a beacon of engineering prowess.
