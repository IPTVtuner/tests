Really
Today, October 01
Steven Moore and Angus Ashworth are out and about in the North East of England. The extremely circuitous open road having somehow taken hundreds of miles to get there from nearby Melrose in the Scottish Borders. There will be Whitby jet, the sheep of the beautiful North York Moors and even a trip back north to Dundee.
