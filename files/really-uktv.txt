Really
Today, June 12
Jules Hudson is in the Herefordshire countryside with a house hunting couple who have a Â£600,000 budget to buy a character family property and a lifestyle dream which they quickly start to re-evaluate on their journey. While in the county, Jules also visits a potato farm which has been in the same family for over ninety years, and sees how business is booming in the mechanised age of 21st century farming.
