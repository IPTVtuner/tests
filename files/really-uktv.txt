Really
Today, March 21
Margie and Paul are shopping in Warwickshire before the last auction in Shrewsbury. Margie goes into hiding, picks up a pair of binoculars and hunts for rare birds, while Paul is having far too much fun in Coventry, ditching the Morris Minor, taking to two wheels and a penny-farthing. The big battle comes down to the little lots at auction: Margie's Victorian miniature shoes go against Paul's tiny toy gun.
