Really
Today, February 23
Presenter and former footballer Alex Scott delves into both sides of her family history. Having known nothing of her Jewish ancestry on her mum's side, Alex is proud to discover that her great grandad was at the Battle of Cable Street in London's East End in 1936, facing down fascist followers of Oswald Mosley. On the other side of her family, Alex's Jamaican grandparents were part of the Windrush generation. Alex travels to Jamaica for the first time in her life, following her beloved nan Philicita's line, and discovers the enormous hardship her great-great-grandmother Henrietta Coombs suffered. Two generations further back, Alex is shaken to learn about another ancestor whose lifetime began during the era of slavery and ended after its abolition.
