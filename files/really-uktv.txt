Jacqui Joseph is in the West Midlands on the lookout for quality discards at Walsall Recycling Centre. There are pine kitchen units to be transformed with the help of carpenter Bruce Faulseit, some life jackets and water skiing ropes that bag maker Rosanna Gethin hopes to make shipshape, and it's a pair of mid-century dining chairs that Jacqui sets to work on.
