Today, February 27
Upcycling supremo Jacqui Joseph is in High Wycombe, exploring the recycling centre for items that can be given a new lease of life rather than hitting the rubbish heap. She finds a nest of tables, an inflatable pool and dinghy and a collection of wooden chairs. With the help of designer Ayo Daramola-Martin and bag maker Neil Wragg, will Jacqui succeed in producing profits from all three salvaged items?
