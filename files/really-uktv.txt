Really
Today, February 26
Sarah Moore is at Witley recycling centre in search of tired and unwanted items she can transform from skip-bound to stylish. With three items saved, Sarah turns to design duo Josh and Oli to repurpose an old mower, while upholsterer Leigh-Anne Treadwell goes out on a limb with her redesign of a pair of teak chairs. Sarah's challenge is to find new homes for three Persian rugs, but will her eclectic items prove to be too past-it to make a profit?
