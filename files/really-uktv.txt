Really
Today, April 01
Jacqui Joseph is in the Midlands, determined to save quality items from ending up on the scrapheap at Walsall Recycling Centre. She rescues some cast-iron bench ends, an oak cabinet cum telephone table and three dining chairs. With the help of blacksmith Kev Paxton and screenprint artist Daniel Heath, the tired items have the chance to shine once more. But will Jacqui manage to sell them on for a profit?
