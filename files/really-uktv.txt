Really
Today, February 21
With a swirl of tartan and a burst of the bagpipes, our Scottish tour continues in Fife with antiques experts Natasha Raskin Sharp and Steven Moore. The 1960s Rolls Royce glides the pair through countryside and town as they head from the east coast to central Scotland. Natasha's money reserves are dwindling, so she cautiously settles on a bargain piece of Scottish studio pottery. However, a canny buy of an arts and crafts-style lantern pays dividends at the auction in Hamilton.
