Really
Today, May 31
The exciting Road Trip debut of a very familiar face! Antiques dealer Paul Martin finally gets behind the wheel of a classic car, accompanied by seasoned tripper and auctioneer Raj Bisram. Together the pair kick off their treasure hunt in an open-topped motor around the B-roads of Sussex. Paul loves furniture and art, but what can he acquire with a modest Â£200? Raj's keen eye for trends in the antiques biz means he's simply looking for a profit-making bargain.
