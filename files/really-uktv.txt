Really
Today, August 06
Tim Medhurst and Phil Serrell are touring the byways and waterways of the Cotswolds. But while Tim is in the sporty motor, Phil is on the slow boat. Moneybags Tim tries to maintain his lead by investing in some eclectic choices: a brass top hat, a French marriage globe and a travelling font, which may or may not add blessings to his already stuffed pockets. Phil is aiming to strike back at auction with some Chinese rice paintings and an old porthole, thrown in for free.
