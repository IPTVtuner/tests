Raj Bisram and Paul Martin's 'Way Out West' tour takes them to deepest Dorset, Devon, Somerset and beyond.

Along the way, Paul ditches the classic car to investigate the obscure, Somerset-based Victorian inventor of unmanned powered flight, before having a go at a bit of modern model aeronautics himself.
