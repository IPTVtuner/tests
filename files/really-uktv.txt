Really
Today, November 07
Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First to arrive at the barn are Judith Holliman and her son James. They have brought a dear old friend - a stuffed owl called Wol. Judith clearly remembers him peeking out of her Christmas stocking when she was just a few years old, and they have been inseparable ever since. He was a gift from her beloved grandmother, who helped to raise her, and Wol is constant reminder of her grandmother's love. But the decades of hugs and kisses have rather worn out Wol, and he could really do with the expert care of bear ladies Amanda and Julie. Musical maestro David Burville welcomes Kathryn Freeman from Hertfordshire. He is excited to get his healing hands on her family's miniature piano, which is now in a sorry state. Kathryn grew up with five older sisters, and this pint-sized piano provided hours of entertainment for them all.
