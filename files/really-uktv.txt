Really
Today, May 19
A new antiques adventure sets off with good pals Natasha Raskin Sharp and Margie Cooper. Behind the wheel of their 1960's motor they start out in the west of Scotland, en route to an auction in Dumfries. Their trip through bonnie Scotland inspires some local purchases. A model of a Scottish terrier intrigues one expert, while their rival plumps for a Robert Burns-themed object.
