North West Ambulance Service mobilises extra resources as thousands of visitors arrive in Liverpool for the Grand National weekend. Paramedic crew and sisters Danielle and Stacey are stationed at Aintree racecourse on Friday for Ladies' Days, and their first human casuality is a previous winner of the Grand National who has fallen from a horse, broken his ankle and will have to miss the big race the next day. On Saturday, Daniel and Stacey are sent to a jockey who has fallen in the big race.
