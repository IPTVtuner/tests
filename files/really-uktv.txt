Really
Today, February 21
It's the final instalment of Natasha Raskin Sharp and Steven Moore's Road Trip around Scotland. Natasha splashes out a three-figure sum on a single piece of silver. She also picks up buttons with a suffragist connection and a very charming brass tortoise. Shopping done, a hungry Natasha visits Cupar to find out why haggis has became a global delicacy synonymous with Scotland. To Steven's great joy, his first shop is a ceramics expert's dream.
