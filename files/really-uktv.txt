Really
Today, December 18
Sarah Moore scours Witley's recycling centre and uncovers three items she can save, transform and sell on for profit. She picks some faded curtains for bag maker Rosanna Gethin, and a 1950s chest of drawers gets some much-needed attention from screen print artist Zoe Murphy. Sarah tries to find a new use for an old storage larder.
