Today, May 26
Charlie and James start out amongst the hop gardens and orchards of Kent and manoeuvre their bright red classic Alfa Romeo around some of the county's finest antique shops. On the way they also explore a cold war submarine and discover how Pocahontas came to Kent, before arriving at an auction in Washington, West Sussex.
