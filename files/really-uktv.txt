Really
Today, August 09
Two of TV's favourite doctors, Dr Ranj Singh and Dr Zoe Williams, are paired with experts Steph Connell and Tim Medhurst. Both are hoping to catch the antiques bug as they search for curios and collectables in Lancashire and Greater Manchester, all in the hope of making a profit at auction in North Yorkshire. In a distraction from the shops, Ranj fulfils his dream of dancing in Blackpool with an audition to join the Tiller Girls.
