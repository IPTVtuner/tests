Really
Today, October 24
Antiquers Natasha Raskin Sharp and Steven Moore begin a Road Trip adventure, motoring through North Yorkshire and Tyne and Wear in grand style behind the wheel of a 1960s Rolls Royce. Steven flushes out a bargain while visiting the loo in one antiques shop, finding some 18th-century tea bowls hidden away by the toilet. A break from shopping sees Steven set sail to South Shields and learn about the incredible restoration of a quite remarkable lifeboat.
