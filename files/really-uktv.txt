Really
Today, May 21
It's the last leg of the trip for antiques dealer Margie Cooper and auctioneer Natasha Raskin Sharp. It has been a close battle, so can either of them pull ahead as they go searching for antiques in the dales of Derbyshire? Maybe Margie can, as she has bagged the classic car, leaving Natasha puffing up the hills in her wake on a pushbike. They both shop until they drop, buying everything from delicate glassware to hearty rustic pieces, with an animal-shaped cocktail shaker thrown into the mix.
