Really
Today, May 22
Phil Serrell and Timothy Medhurst continue their road trip in Scotland behind the wheel of a 1970s convertible. Phil discovers some gastronomic treats in Perthshire, including a fine scone in Scone, the rejuvenating properties of a tea brewed from the leaves of the birch tree, and some tasty tree sap. Tim, meanwhile, turns Jacobite and leads a one-man highland charge at Killiecrankie, where redcoats turned tail in the battle of 1689.
