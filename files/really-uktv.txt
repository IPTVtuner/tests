Upcycler Jay Blades is at Walsall Recycling Centre in the West Midlands on a mission to rescue and revive unwanted items. With three eclectic skip-finds to transform, Jay turns to upholsterer Leigh-Anne Treadwell to get creative with a swivel chair, while designer Daniel Heath tackles a sideboard. Jay takes on a bedroom chair as his own creative project.
