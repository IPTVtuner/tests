Really
Today, February 14
Scottish lassie Roo Irvine finds herself with home advantage as she's joined by David Harper on the west coast of Scotland for this leg of their road trip. After Roo's head gets stuck in an antique, she decides to stick with what she knows best: old glass. Aside from buying antiques, Roo indulges her sweet tooth and learns about gelato and why this Italian dessert is so popular in Scotland. David examines a rare personal collection that tells the story of a once-booming industry.
