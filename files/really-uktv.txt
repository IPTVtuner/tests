Really
Today, December 11
Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First is a poignant story of a very precious keepsake. Rose Werner and her sister Linda have travelled from Essex in the hope that Suzie Fletcher can turn her expertise to a decorative leather box that they hold dear. It belonged to Rose's late husband Jim. He arrived in the UK as a teenage refugee just before the Second World War, thanks to the Kindertransport scheme.
