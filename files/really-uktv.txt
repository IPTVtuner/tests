Sarah Moore is at Keynsham Recycling Centre to stop quality discards from ending up in the skip. She intercepts a deconstructed dressing table, a wartime crittall window and an ancient kilim rug. With the help of upcycler Sarah Peterson and carpentry duo Josh Kennard and Oli Milne, the three items are revitalised ready to hopefully sell on and turn a profit for their original owners.
