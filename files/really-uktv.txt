Really
Today, May 31
It is the final leg of our journey with veteran tripper Raj Bisram and relative rookie Paul Martin. After an epic tour of the south and south west, their shopping and saleroom extravaganza concludes at a Palladian mansion in the Cotswolds. The open-topped classic car transports our duo to Shakespeare country, Warwickshire, where dealer Paul and auctioneer Raj hope to acquire anything 'going for a sonnet'. They find out about alpacas and llamas, and discover the historical roots of ballet.
