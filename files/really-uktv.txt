Upcycling expert EJ Osborne is scouring the skips at Llanfoist Recycling Centre in Monmouthshire, searching for three items he can rework to reveal their true potential. To help him on his quest, EJ enlists two magnificent makers, upholsterers Simion Hawtin-Smith and Sharon O'Connor. Simion has his hands full with a sofa bed and armchair while Sharon must come up with a big idea for a tired piano stool.
