Today, February 20
Sarah Moore is in East Lothian determined to save quality items from ending up on the scrapheap at Wallyford Recycling Centre. A vintage chair and table, a little leather suitcase and a painters table all catch her attention. With the help of upcycler Sarah Peterson and audio engineer Mark `Horse' Phillips, Sarah sets to work trying to transform the salvaged items into profit makers.
