Really
Today, February 21
Road Trip favourite Phil Serrell takes on antiques whipper-snapper Tim Medhurst on an adventure on both sides of Hadrian's Wall, travelling in a fine 1970s convertible. Phil shows his brawn with a couple of shot puts before tackling some hedgerows with a billhook, while Tim fancies himself a winner on the fairway with an Edwardian golfer's ashtray. Phil gets involved with a small army of soldiers, but Tim is keen on militaria too, and he lands a collectable from the First World War.
