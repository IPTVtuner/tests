Today, November 21
Anita Manning starts this leg negotiating hard in an attempt to catch Raj Bisram's early lead. Behind the wheel of a Triumph Spitfire they shop in Norfolk heading for an auction in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex. Anita learns about much forgotten Norwich lad Vernon Castle, who was once a global dancing phenomenon. Taking a break from antiques, Raj heads to the stunning Blicking Hall to find out about its controversial former owner, Lord Lothian.
