Really
Today, February 19
The third outing with Raj Bisram and Paul Martin. Given that it is dealer Paul's very first Road Trip experience, it is a good thing he has his chum Raj alongside him in the classic roadster. Just how chummy they will be when the auction rolls around remains to be seen. The pair explore the Cotswolds and the Mendips in style. Along the way, they discover the story of the fascinating Yorkshireman who not only discovered oxygen, but also had a big hand in the invention of the gin and tonic.
