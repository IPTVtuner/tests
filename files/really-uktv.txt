Today, May 16
It's a dramatic start to the shift for the charity funded Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) who are monitoring the calls made to the North East Ambulance Service. An urgent call is received for a car that's fallen from a bridge onto the A1. Critical care paramedic Jemma and pre-hospital doctor Kate are dispatched to deliver hospital level emergency care to the patient on the roadside. Across Northumberland, crews are booking on for the twelve-hour day shift.
