Really
Today, March 28
Sarah Moore leaves no stone unturned at Witley Recycling Centre in Surrey as she searches for gems among the junk which can be transformed and sold on for a profit. She discovers some rusted bench ends and a garden table, and sets upholsterer Leigh-Anne Treadwell to work on them. There's a cherished but dated dressing table for carpenter Carwyn Owen to modernise, and Sarah comes up with a clever restyle of some old garment factory containers.
