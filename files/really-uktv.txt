Really
Today, February 21
Tim comes over all Olympic-cyclist with the lycra, looking more and more at home on his bike. Former PE teacher Phil takes a break from driving the old Triumph to walk through the treetops at the national arboretum, a challenge for a man with vertigo. Making their way through Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, coin expert Tim is excited by a Victorian half crown, while Phil is positively overjoyed when he secures a chair made for the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969.
