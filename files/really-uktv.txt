Really
Today, February 28
In this adventure around the south coast in a zippy 1976 Alfa Romeo Spider, auctioneer and lover of all things sparkly Izzie Balmer takes on veteran Road Tripper and silver expert Catherine Southon. Catherine is a shopping pro, snapping up everything from a decorative lavatory to an art nouveau pendant, while Izzie starts off slowly but soon becomes the antiques dog whisperer with a bevy of doggie delights. Away from the shops, Izzie demonstrates a knack for Bronze Age DIY.
