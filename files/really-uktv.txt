Really
Today, April 15
There's a piratical mood for antiques experts Raj Bisram and Irita Marriott as they set sail on their final outing together. There are shops to plunder and booty to be bought as they explore the very tip of the Cornish peninsula. And with the competition being so close at this point, the pressure is on to find that auction-winning item. Raj makes some big finds in one of the tiniest shops of the trip and pins his hopes on a risky item that may or may not be highly collectable.
