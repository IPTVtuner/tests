Today, October 14
We follow ambulance crews in Aberdeenshire, Edinburgh and Paisley, and the special operations response teams as they deal with the most serious calls. In Aberdeen, ambulance crew Sarah and Stewart are called to a lady who has fallen at home and needs to be checked over, while not too far away, near Peterhead, an elderly patient who has difficulties moving needs to be transferred to hospital. Ambulance crew Ricky and Luan use their skills to help him safely into the ambulance.
