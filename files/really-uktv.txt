Really
Today, March 20
The rain fails to dampen spirits in Scarborough but the roof on the convertible Morris Minor remains firmly shut. On the way to an auction in Rotherham, Paul indulges his top two passions of militaria and collecting as he hears about a hero of WWI who continued to spend a fortune on collectibles while under fire in the trenches. Meanwhile, Margie heads to Whitby to find out about local sailors who went to sea in birds' nests.
