Really
Today, April 25
We're dishing up the penultimate road trip marvel with Paul Laidlaw and Claire Rawle. Kicking off in Hull, the pair motor their TVR Tuscan around the North East of England. Paul finds a rare 18th-century puzzle jug, a charming novelty of the period. Claire hopes some Shelley porcelain will do well at auction.
