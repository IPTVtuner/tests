First to arrive is Tom Wenham, with a pair of running shoes used by his grandma when she represented Great Britain at the Berlin Olympics in 1936. The bespoke shoes enabled Audrey and her relay teammates to race their way to a silver medal in front of Hitler. Repairing the running shoes is a huge responsibility for the barn's newest recruit, cobbler Dean Westmoreland.
