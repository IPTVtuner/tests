Today, May 29
The antiques adventure continues in Devon with auctioneers Izzie Balmer and Catherine Southon, who rule the road in a racy red 1970s Alfa Romeo Spider. With unbelievable excitement, Izzie embarks on a spending spree that involves 18th-century porcelain and a quirky Georgian marrow scoop. As a lover of all creatures great and small, she also relishes the opportunity to find out about the sporting parson who created the ultimate fox terrier.
