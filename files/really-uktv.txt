Really
Today, July 24
Sarah Moore is in Witley, hoping to find treasure in the skips of the local recycling centre. She sets furniture artist Chloe Kempster to work on a chest of drawers, whilst Guy Trench needs to put his best foot forward with some dated shoe lasts. Sarah sets herself the challenge of repurposing some rusty hanging baskets.
