Today, May 15
Auctioneers, experts and chums James Braxton and Charles Hanson set out on the second leg of their latest trip together. After kicking off in the Chiltern Hills at Wendover, our two trippers take a classic car each to wind their way across several counties. But who will find the treasure required for victory at the saleroom? Charles motors his 1950s MG into Buckinghamshire and gets very excited about an Arts and Crafts occasional table.
