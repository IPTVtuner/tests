Really
Today, February 03
Irita Marriott and Phil Serrell have arrived in Northumberland on the last leg of their tour, where Phil takes a punt on an antique pump for the second time before coming face to face with a scarecrow made in his own image. Irita takes a painterly turn, fancying a French work of art, and goes back to school Pre-Raphaelite-style in the model village of Ford, where she follows in the footsteps of little-known artist Lady Louisa Waterford.
