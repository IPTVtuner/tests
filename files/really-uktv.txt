Alistair Appleton is on a country property hunt in Cumbria with a triathlete couple armed with Â£400,000 who need a family home for them and their three children before the new school term starts. Whilst in the area, Alistair also visits Stott Park Bobbin Mill, the last working example in the UK, and learns the important role it played supplying a quarter of a million bobbins every week to the Victorian cotton mills of Lancashire.
