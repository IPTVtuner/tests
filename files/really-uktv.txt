Today, November 01
Antiques aficionados Anita Manning and Raj Bisram take in the delights of Suffolk, Kent and Surrey before heading back to Essex for their third auction. Each expert has won an auction, so it's all to play for. Anita rests from shopping to visit a former silk mill with an incredible royal connection. Meanwhile, Raj hears about the birth of interior design and the pioneering artist behind it William Morris.
