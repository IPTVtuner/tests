Really
Today, November 01
It's the fourth leg of this Scottish extravaganza with auctioneer Izzie Balmer and dealer David Harper. As it happens, they'll be awfully close to St Andrews, 'the home of golf', so perhaps we should call it leg fore! For their rummage around Fife, Perthshire and Angus, Izzie and David have a trusty vintage Mini and whatever funds they have successfully accrued on top of their Â£200 starting sum. Izzie finds a very rare jar that results in a bidding war at auction, much to David's despair.
