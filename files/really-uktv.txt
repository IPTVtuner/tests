The North West Ambulance Service serves 1.4 million people across Merseyside. Cameras follow their crews while the whole of the country is in lockdown, and in addition to the pressure on the service as the coronavirus epidemic peaks, plans are underway to tackle the immediate threat to life posed by Storm Christoph. As the storm intensifies, river levels throughout the north west are rising, and the service is at risk of becoming overwhelmed.
