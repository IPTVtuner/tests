Really
Today, March 07
It's the penultimate leg for hot shot auctioneers Charlie Ross and James Braxton, as they continue their journey in a Ford Zephyr. James is currently out in the lead as they kick off in Rushden, Northamptonshire, which means Charlie is playing catch up as they search for perfect purchases in Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Will he have done enough to beat James when they take their lots to auction in St Albans, Hertfordshire?
