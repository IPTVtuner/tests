Really
Today, January 10
A new adventure for experts Paul Laidlaw and Margie Cooper in a Morris Minor: starting in Lincolnshire, they take aim for North Yorkshire and an auction in Harrogate. Margie's visit to a haunted antique shop sees her trying to contact the other side, and she also picks up a bevy of antiques including a rather large Royal Dux figurine. Paul is on the scent of militaria and picks up some rather interesting plunder.
