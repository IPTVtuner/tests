Antiques aficionados Roo Irvine and David Harper are on the third leg of their road trip, cruising around the north west in their trusty chariot, a replica 1960s AC Cobra. When David finds a carved cat at the bargain price of a pound, he's confident it will make a purr-fect profit at the Dundee auction. He also takes a journey back in time to discover the horrifying environment of the workhouses that were once prevalent across the country.
