Really
Today, March 11
Phil finds his sea legs with a spot of sailing in the Firth of Clyde whilst Steph tries her hand at weaving tartan on a traditional Renfrewshire loom. A visit to a salvage emporium means Phil is in his element as he discovers a cabinet that once displayed one of the world's most expensive books.
