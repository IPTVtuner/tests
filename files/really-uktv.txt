In Edinburgh, ambulance crew Moira and Blair are called to a man with severe chest pain who needs to be checked and taken to hospital right away. In Aberdeen, on the night shift, Ricky and Luan get a call to a man who has fallen at home, and who turns out to be one of the more entertaining patients they have seen in a while.
