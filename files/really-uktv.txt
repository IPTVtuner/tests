Resident clock expert Steven Fletcher and woodwork specialist William Kirk work together to repair a broken barometer clock. With a clock, barometer and thermometer on one object Steven has a lot of work ahead of him to get it looking like new again. Painting conservator Lucia Scalisi draws on her years of experience to restore a beautiful Caputo painting which has suffered a large tear. She expertly mends, cleans and re-touches the painting in time to reunite it with its delighted owner.
