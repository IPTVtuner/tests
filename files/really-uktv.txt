Today, October 16
Showbiz mates Peter Andre and Joe Pasquale sample the joys of the Kent seaside. And while no-one gets an ice-cream Joe is treated to some whelks while Peter rides on the oldest rollercoaster in Britain. Joe persuades expert Catherine Southon to buy a pommel horse emblazoned with the name of its former owner: HMP Broadmoor. While Paul Laidlaw impresses his celebrity sidekick Peter with a pressed poppy from the battlefields of World War One.
