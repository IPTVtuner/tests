Really
Today, February 07
Filmed in the autumn of 2019, cameras follow a new cast of characters from the London Ambulance Service as they care for the nine million people of the city. Advanced Paramedic Kev is dispatched to a cardiac arrest. While the ambulance crews on scene continue to give CPR, Kev's attentions turn to support the family members anxiously waiting. There is brief hope when they get a pulse back, but the patient needs to be urgently transferred to hospital, and a van is blocking the ambulance's path.
