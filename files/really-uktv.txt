Really
Today, November 02
Starting in Inverkeithing, Charles Hanson and James Braxton drive through Fife and Perthshire picking up antiques to sell at auction in Dundee. James hopes a gamble purchase of an expensive Chinese rosewood table will steal him the lead from Charles. Meanwhile, Charles detours from the shops to hear how one man's passion for birds inspired him to be the first human to fly, while James uncovers the story of a top secret naval base and its role in winning World War Two.
