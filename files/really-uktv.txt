Today, May 26
Antiques aficionados Christina Trevanion and Serhat Ahmet wander around the West Midlands and the Black Country. And there's a new addition to the Road Trip convoy, a very robust Series One Land Rover. Not as nippy as the Porsche Speedster but better over the bumps. Both experts decide to play to their strengths this time out. Porcelain dealer Serhat gets his paws on a lot of ceramics while Christina goes a bundle on one of her favourites: jewellery.
