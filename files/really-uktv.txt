Really
Today, February 25
The final battleground for our intrepid auctioneers, Philip Serrell and Izzie Balmer, will be the antiques emporia of Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire. Whilst our pair celebrate their new found friendship, it doesn't mean that they've lost their competitive streak - they're both in it to win it. And it looks like the third member of the team, their classic car, might be restored to its former glory. Phil, who has to play hunt-the-shopkeeper, has his eye on a few quality antique staples.
