Really
Today, March 20
Paul Laidlaw and Margie Cooper kick off in medieval York and motor their Morris Minor to auction in Darlington. Paul learns about the man credited as the `father of aviation' and the story of how this aristocrat sent his footman skyward in a hand-built wooden plane, with obvious consequences. Meanwhile, Margie hears about a 19th-century beast wrestler who championed British wildlife.
