Really
Today, August 14
This south west adventure concludes with a tour of Devon, Somerset and Dorset for auctioneers Izzie Balmer and Catherine Southon. Izzie buys some liqueur glasses, a Victorian chandelier and yet more brooches before settling on a river bank, in a top secret location, on the lookout for a very rare animal. Catherine takes a risk with the purchase of a massive anchor with no provenance, but plays it safe with some Georgian shoe buckles.
