The staff of North West Ambulance Service care for the 1.4 million people of Merseyside during the most deadly phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. The morning shift begins with a 999 call regarding a patient who has fallen 20 feet from a ladder. Advanced paramedic Naomi is immediately dispatched. Crewmates Jack and Jack are dispatched to a patient who is struggling to breathe. A week into the new year lockdown, Covid infections are at their peak: one in four calls to the service concerned.
