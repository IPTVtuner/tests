Really
Today, February 13
Roo Irvine and David Harper are driving around Yorkshire and Country Durham in a noisy and sporty 1960s motor, seeking out antiques to sell at auction. David buys an old fishing stool in the hope of landing a big profit at the Newcastle auction. However, the joke may be on Roo, who splashes out on an unusual purchase of a parachuting clown. A detour from the antiques emporia of York sees David discover a little-known 19th-century inventor whose incredible innovations are still relevant today.
