Really
Today, October 20
It is the second leg of this jaunt with debutant Paul Martin and his seasoned tripper chum Raj Bisram. Paul is a dealer and certainly knows his way around an antiques shop. Raj, meanwhile, is an auctioneer with a competitive streak and is not giving any dispensation to his new pal, a Road Trip rookie. Our pair are sharing the driving duties as they head west in their open-topped roadster. Today's treasure tour also includes a stop-off in the New Forest to learn about wartime despatch riders.
