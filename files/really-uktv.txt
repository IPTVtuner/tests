Really
Today, February 16
It's a Caledonian canter in a classic coup√©, as the pair hit the shops looking for goodies to sell at auction. While Margie goes all mushy for a vintage monkey pyjama case, Natasha takes a chance with a rare piece of Victoriana. There's also a bit of sightseeing along the way as Natasha hones her boat-building skills and Margie seeks the stars in the darkest of dark skies.
