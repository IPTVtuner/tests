Today, the experienced road trippers, auctioneers and chums will start shopping in Suffolk before ending up on the Kent coast at Chatham. But whose buys will make the most profit at auction? Each expert takes to the road in his own classic car to fill with treasure. Charles gambles a huge sum of money on a 200-year-old oil painting, whereas James decides to play it safe.
