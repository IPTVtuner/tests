Today, July 05
An unreliable classic car has Charles Hanson and James Braxton complete this leg on foot! After buying antiques in Perthshire and the Lothians, Charles hears how drovers would move cattle from the Scottish Highlands to market in Stirling and has a jolly good go at it himself. Meanwhile, James learns about Einstein's inspiration and one of the greatest scientists in history, James Clerk Maxwell.
