Really
Today, January 30
Irita Marriott and Phil Serrell take a sports car for a blast on a road trip in East Anglia. They are soon carried away by the good weather, Phil dons his shorts and Irita runs away to Great Yarmouth to join the circus. The world's first radar station is on Phil's itinerary, and on the antiques radar there's everything from a garden fountain to a homemade post box. Finally, they swap the flash wheels for some vintage bubble cars as their purchases go under the hammer.
