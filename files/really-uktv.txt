TV's `Loose Women' Andrea McLean and Penny Lancaster take time off from their panellist duties to get behind the wheel of a classic car and head out into the county of Essex, in search of fun and profit. With excellent antiques expert guidance, courtesy of auctioneer Tim Medhust and dealer David Harper they're sure to be in for an entertaining ride.
