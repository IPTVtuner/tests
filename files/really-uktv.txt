Really
Today, May 29
Auctioneers Izzie Balmer and Catherine Southon have made it to the Cornish coast with the aid of a swanky 1970s Alfa Romeo Spider and a not-so-glamorous, good old-fashioned bicycle. Izzie remains true to form and picks up some Scandinavian jewellery before squeezing into a wetsuit and plunging into the history of surfing in Newquay. Catherine continues her quirky buying streak, which this time includes a Bristol Blue glass lamp stand and a set of celestial charts.
