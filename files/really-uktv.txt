Really
Today, February 01
Irita and Phil tour County Durham, where Phil tries to shape up by pumping iron in the form of a water feature, while Irita goes clubbing Edwardian-style. Phil has a bash at organ restoration, and Irita takes a trip back to the heyday of British seaside holidays at Whitley Bay's Spanish City. They trawl the emporia of the north east from Barnard Castle to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, having challenged each other to spend all their money.
