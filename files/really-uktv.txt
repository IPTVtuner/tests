Upcycling entrepreneur EJ Osborne is at the Llanfoist Recycling Centre in Wales where he is searching the boots for potential loot. Assisting EJ in his mission to rescue, revamp and re-home three pieces of skip-bound trash are furniture restorer Katie Keat and carpenter Ollie Allen. An oak cabinet will be given some restoration TLC by Katie, while Ollie will attempt to re-purpose a slab of granite.
