Today, April 07
Steven Moore and Angus Ashworth, plus their shiny, white Hillman Super Minx called `Betty', are shopping their way along the byways of Scotland. Yorkshireman Angus bags something aromatic and coffee related, while Geordie new boy Steven plumps for a little treasure from his fellow tripper's back yard in Yorkshire.
