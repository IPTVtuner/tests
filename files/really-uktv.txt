Really
Today, May 27
We follow three stories of sons coming to terms with the past. Our first story catches up with Marc Wolfe, who we reunited with his birth mother Esther in 2017. Unfortunately, we find out that they have subsequently struggled to form a bond. Our second story was too delicate to share on television until now. In 2017 Sheila Knox came to us desperate to find the baby she gave up for adoption when she was a 15-year-old schoolgirl.
