Today, March 27
Jacqui Joseph is at Walsall Recycling Centre hoping to uncover some treasures buried amongst the skip-bound trash. To help rescue a rattan two-seater sofa, Jacqui enlists the help of expert upholsterer Leigh-Anne Treadwell, and lighting designer Duncan McKean has some bright ideas for a pair of very old radios. Jacqui sets herself the challenge of revitalising a dated glass display unit.
