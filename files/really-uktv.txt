Today, October 01
Sarah Moore is on a mission to rescue three unloved and unwanted items from Wallyford Recycling Centre in Scotland. To help her on her quest, Sarah turns to designer maker Rupert Blanchard to come up with a creative new use for some wooden garden chairs, while carpenter Bruce Faulseit is tasked with turning a redundant sewing machine stand into something special. Sarah then takes on the ambitious project of restyling a pair of bedside tables.
