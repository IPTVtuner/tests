Really
Today, February 24
Sarah Moore is at Keynsham Recycling Centre on a mission to stop quality discards from ending up in the skips. She intercepts a canvas army bed, a metal gate and drain cover and a tulip table. With the help of leather crafter Uzo Okwuosa and blacksmith Kev Paxton, Sarah hopes to give new life to the old items, but will she harvest any profits by selling them on?
