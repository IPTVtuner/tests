Really
Today, March 26
Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Wood whizz Will Kirk takes on the huge responsibility of restoring a model ship, carefully handcrafted out of matchsticks by a beloved father who died when his children were still small. This is one of the only possessions that owner Lesley has from her dad who she lost when she was just seven. It is a painstaking job for Will, who leaves Lesley truly overwhelmed with his meticulous repair.
