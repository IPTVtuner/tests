Celebrities Craig Charles and Robert Llewellyn are teaming up with antique experts Izzie Balmer and Tim Medhurst. Swapping Red Dwarf for a little red Ferrari, this is a road trip around the West Midlands searching for relics of a bygone age they can snap up and sell on at auction for a profit. Robert is smitten with a 200-year-old love letter while Craig splurges on a multitude of quirky curios.
