Catherine Southon and Philip Serrell are road tripping along the beautiful Cornish coastline in a classic Citroen DS20, in the hunt for antique treasures. Before the auction in Bristol, Catherine heads to Porthcurno to see firsthand the incredible cables that stretch from this little village, along the sea bed, to South America, Australia and India. Meanwhile, Phil goes for a ride on a replica of the Puffing Devil - one of the first steam powered vehicles in the world, gosh!
