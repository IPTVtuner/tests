Really
Today, April 13
In the centre of Ireland, at one of the few inland lake lifeboat stations, the crew of Lough Ree are called out to one of islands in the Lough to reports that the island's last known inhabitant has suffered a stroke. While on the North East coast of England, the crew of Blyth race to find a sea kayaker in trouble in rough conditions, but since he raised the alarm on his mobile phone there's been no further contact from the casualty.
