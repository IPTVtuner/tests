Sarah Moore is in Surrey checking out the cast-offs at Witley Recycling Centre. She's on a mission to save three unwanted items before they hit the skip. Furniture restorer Katie Keat has her work cut out repairing an old chest of drawers while upholsterer Simion Hawtin-Smith tries to give a pair of chairs a total redesign.
