Really
Today, October 17
Tim and Irita tour Somerset, acquainting themselves with public houses along the way. Newbie expert, Irita, detours to the golden age of sailing ships with a visit to a restored Victorian sail and twineworks, and continues her quest to find some fine porcelain in order to make a profit at auction. Tim is taken by some old apothecary bottles, even if he can't say the word.
