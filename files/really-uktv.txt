Really
Today, May 14
Old hands Charles Hanson and James Braxton are out and about in Oxfordshire. It is the third time out together for these two. Charles won on both of those occasions, so he is looking to make it a hat-trick, while James is hoping to score a first victory over his younger rival. They will be taking in the sights in a 1959 MG, assuming Charles can work the gearbox. Charles struggles with the fact that his tastes are a bit too upmarket for his Â£200 budget.
