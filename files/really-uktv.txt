Really
Today, October 13
It's the last outing for antiques dealers Roo Irvine and David Harper, and they are on a whistle-stop tour of the Lake District, battling each other, and the elements, in a sporty classic car. David's hunt for antiques unearths a secret map issued by the RAF, but with time ticking before the auction, Roo gambles on a Georgian longcase clock. David learns about the Cambrian sport of hound trailing, which sees dogs running for miles with only the scent of aniseed to guide them.
