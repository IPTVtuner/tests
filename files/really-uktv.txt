Really
Today, March 31
Seasoned trippers Natasha Raskin Sharp and James Braxton explore the back roads of Devon and Somerset from behind the wheel of a fiery-red Porsche. They're up for the challenge of finding profitable antiques and even pen the odd verse of poetry along the way. James has an eye for some Scandinavian furniture ideal for serving cocktails while Natasha indulges her cute and cuddly side as she gets her hands on a menagerie of furry creatures.
