Christmas has well and truly arrived at Manor Farm - bringing the festive cheer are Anita Dobson, Ben Miller, and Moira Stuart. Horticulturist Camilla Bassett-Smith celebrates Christmas Victorian style, we see how the animals at Port Lympne and Howletts Zoo spend the big day, Andy Clarke has the best in Christmas cocktails and we meet some very special Shetland ponies.
