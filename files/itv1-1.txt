Ainsley's Mediterranean exploration continues on the Italian island of Sardinia. He takes a pasta masterclass with the most wonderful hosts Erica and Alessandro, who teach Ainsley how to make a uniquely Sardinian pasta shape called Jiusoni, which he then uses in his outrageously good sausage and fennel pasta. Then, up in the beautiful hills, he cooks up a true Italian classic with a Sardinian twist, fregola minestrone.
