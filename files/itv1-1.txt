Alan and his team are in Leeds to come to the aid of Penny and Carl, whose devotion to saving endangered hedgehogs has taken over any family space in their garden - inspired by Penny's selfless work, the team set out to create a wildlife garden that looks sensational, appeals to all the family, and is a haven for all creatures great and small. With a natural design based around curves, Alan's family area has a new lawn with a firepit and seating area for cosy summer evenings.
