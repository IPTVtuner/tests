Laura Woods presents coverage from the ARMCO Arena as Solihull Moors face Bromley in action from the second round of the 2024-25 FA Cup - non-league Solihull Moors saw off Maidstone United convincingly in the previous round with a 3-0 win and will eye up another victory and Cup upset against their League Two opponents. Meanwhile, visitors Bromley will be hoping for a repeat result from the clubs' meeting at the National League play-off final in May 2024 in which they beat Bromley on penalties.
