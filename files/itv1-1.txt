John and Lisa have some cost-effective ideas in their Christmas Kitchen this time, recipes that deliver on both value and taste. They start with an alternative to turkey - a Christmas ham served with a mustard sauce - before Lisa makes a delicious pasta dish of a special cannelloni that's perfect for Christmas Eve. John then has the ultimate festive toasted sandwich that is full of all your favourite leftovers, and for dessert is an apple and cranberry bread and butter pudding.
