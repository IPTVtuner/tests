The next stop on Bradley and Barney Walsh's European road trip is Switzerland. They take in the breath-taking views with a ride on a mountain rollercoaster, before exercising their vocal chords when they try the Swiss tradition of yodeling. The following day, Barney arranges a unique way for them to enjoy some local cheese, and then drive to the Contra Dam, where Barney reveals they are about to attempt one of James Bond's most iconic stunts, a petrifying 220 metre-high bungee jump.
