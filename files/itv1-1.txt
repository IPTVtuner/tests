Bradley and Barney Walsh continue their European adventure in Germany. They head to the city of Frankfurt, where Brad is literally pushed to the edge as he attempts to abseil down the side of a building, facing forwards. The boys also make a stop at a bratwurst-themed hotel, and soak up some local Bavarian culture when they have a go at finger wrestling. The pair finish off their time in Germany with a wet and wild adventure in the mountains.
