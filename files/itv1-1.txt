South Africa play their final game of the group stages as they look to secure a place in the last eight - the loss of key man Malcolm Marx has dented their prospects, but Eben Etzebeth, Faf De Klerk, Manie Libbok, and inspirational skipper Siya Koilisi mean that they are not lacking in world-class players. Meanwhile, Tonga will relish the physical contest with the defending champions, and they possess undoubted talent of their own in Salesi Piutau and Malakai Fekitoa.
