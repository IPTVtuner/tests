David Dickinson and his team are in Stoke-on-Trent to help sellers to get the real deal for their antiques and valuables. This edition sees the dealers take on new roles as Tracy Thackray Howitt plays Dr No for a collection of James Bond books, Tim Hogarth reprises his favourite part as Goldfinger, and Fay Rutter does her best Baywatch babe Pamela Anderson impression - Mark Stevens is also splashing out a big five-figure sum, but only to coin in a profit.
