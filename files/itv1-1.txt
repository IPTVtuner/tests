Today, December 30
Ant and Dec - and a host of famous faces - star in this Agatha Christie-inspired whodunnit. Ant and Dec are invited to the Head of ITV's country manor house alongside the great and good of ITV, but when they start getting bumped off one by one, Ant and Dec must try to work out who the killer is and catch them before it's too late!
