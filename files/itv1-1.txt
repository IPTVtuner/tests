Jimmy Doherty and Shivi Ramoutar present the show that weekends were made for - this time they are joined by country singer Nathan Carter and greet him with a comforting breakfast of cardamon rice pudding with syrupy spiced papaya and a brule top. As Jimmy then pays a visit to the fluffiest residents at the wildlife park - the arctic foxes - as it's feeding time, Shivi takes inspiration from the foxes with a twist on a classic sweet treat in the form of her passion fruit arctic roll.
