It's a plane enthusiasts' special edition at Heathrow as the last super jumbo of the skies, the A380, visits Terminal 3 - elsewhere, passenger numbers are at their highest, there's a dodgy substance in security, and there's also a potential waste disposal issue in a toilet block. Passenger experience manager Suki finds a taxi driver on the floor in agony, and the airport's runway gets a sparkling makeover to help the ever-increasing numbers of aircraft safely land there.
