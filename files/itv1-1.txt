This edition's breakfast is Turkish-style eggs, a perfect blend of creamy yoghurt and spicy butter - Jimmy then makes a feeder for a special resident at the wildlife park, Basil the anteater, and shows Shivi and Alexis how to make simple feeders that ensure that the birds in our gardens are happy and well fed. Later, Shivi visits James - a local cheesemaker using modern technology to improve his dairy's productivity.
