David Dickinson and his team are in Cirencester in Gloucestershire where there are winners and losers amongst the sellers in this edition - the owners of a horse hoof matchbox think that it's worth next to nothing but end up selling it for hundreds of pounds, the seller of an Italian vase bought online learns a tough lesson in the saleroom, and an old watch left in an attic for 40 years turns out to have a big name and a big price tag.
