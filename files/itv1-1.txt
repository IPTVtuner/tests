The Lionesses return to action with two friendly matches from a warm weather camp in Spain, and after failing to qualify for the Nations League finals, England get a chance to reset before they start their qualifying campaign for Euro 2025 - they first take on Austria, a side they played in both the Euro 2022 group stage and their last qualification campaign for the 2023 World Cup and one they have never lost to. Laura Woods presents coverage of the match from the Estadio Nuevo Mirador.
