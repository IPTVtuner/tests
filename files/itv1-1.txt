There's truly life-changing money on offer as Ant and Dec try to help more contestants climb as high up the never-ending money ladder as they can - first up is Terri, who wants to take her sons to Disney, and her best friend Jess who wants to travel the world. It's then husband and wife Paul and Ellie's turn to take on the Limitless Ladder - they play the game competitively when watching at home, but now they try to translate that into a huge win in the studio.
