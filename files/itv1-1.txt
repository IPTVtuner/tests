Joining Alan for some pre-Christmas celebrations are Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who talks about leading the way in musical theatre, and Last Tango in Halifax's Anne Reid - we also pay a visit to Chessington Zoo to see how the animals there are celebrating Christmas, look at the festive tipples to see you through the big day, and get to meet a couple of Shetland ponies too.
