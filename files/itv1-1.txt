Alan is back with a packed show welcoming author and screenwriter Anthony Horowitz, `Dragons' Den' star Deborah Meaden, and broadcaster and host of `The One Show' Alex Jones. David Domoney has tips to brighten up our patios in time for summer, drinks expert Becky Paskin is in charge of refreshments with tea-infused tipples, Lesley Joseph introduces us to the shy blue shark, and we get a look at some of the newest arrivals of the year as the lambing season draws to a close.
