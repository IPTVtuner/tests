A woman of unsettling appearance and magical powers enters the household of the recently widowed Mr Brown and attempts to tame his seven exceedingly badly behaved children. Having already driven away 17 previous nannies, the children are certain that they will have no trouble with Nanny McPhee, but as she takes control, they notice that their vile behaviour now leads swiftly and magically to rather startling consequences.
