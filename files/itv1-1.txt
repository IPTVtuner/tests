The game show is back with host Stephen Mulhern at the helm as the returning contestants prepare to go head-to-head with the notorious Banker - as the first contestant of the second series, Myles must either choose the right boxes and resist the Banker's tempting cash offers until just the right moment to take home a fortune, or hold out until the very end and leave with what's been inside his randomly selected box all along.
