This episode sees Paul visit places long on his Kent bucket list - iconic spots on his doorstep but where he's never set foot before. He starts by heading off on a modern-day pilgrimage to the beautiful city of Canterbury. After failing to impress his pigs with a reading from 'Canterbury Tales', Paul follows the footsteps of Chaucer's pilgrims by visiting the world-famous cathedral. He's not here as a tourist though, instead he's put to work helping out with roof renovations.
