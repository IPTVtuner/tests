Continuing his British Adventure, James travels to Cornwall, where his travelling companion is local hero, chef Paul Ainsworth. James starts with a trip to Camel Valley Vineyard and cooks chicken Veronique amongst the vines. Paul hops across the estuary to taste the award-winning oysters produced by Porthilly Farm, a five-generation family-run dairy farm who diversified into oysters, and James uses some in his individual beef pies with oysters.
