Hugh Woozencroft presents Gallagher Premiership rugby coverage as the Sale Sharks host the Exeter Chiefs - both teams have been inconsistent and unpredictable in the 2023-24 season, and this should therefore produce a fascinating spectacle at the AJ Bell Stadium. Sale were thrashed 43-0 by the Chiefs earlier in the season and will be looking for revenge and some much-needed points to continue their push for a top four finish.
