Ed Chamberlin presents coverage of feature races from Sandown and Wincanton - the best of the action is at Sandown where the Veterans' Chase sees many old favourites in action in a race restricted to older horses. Analysis comes from Mick Fitzgerald and Leonna Mayor, reporting from Alice Plunkett and Oli Bell, and commentary from Richard Hoiles.
