TV personalities Amanda Holden and Alan Carr enthusiastically embrace delving into their family history on a road trip that covers Cornwall, London and Erith. Using both DNA and genealogy, they are able to unlock the secrets of the past and meet close family they never knew existed. In true Upstairs, Downstairs fashion, Amanda's journey starts in the grounds of a stately home in Cornwall, while Alan's journey takes him to a pub in Erith with something of a colourful past.
