Ed Chamberlin and Francesca Cumani present coverage from Doncaster and Chester - the feature meeting of the day is at Doncaster, where the oldest Classic takes centre stage as a top-class field line up for the 2023 St Leger. Chief supporting races include the Portland Handicap, Park Stakes and the Champagne Stakes on what should be a superb afternoon - analysis comes from Jason Weaver and Adele Mulrennan, reporting from Matt Chapman and Sally Ann Grassick, and commentary from Mark Johnson.
