Hugh Woozencroft presents coverage of the 2023-24 Investec Champions Cup pool stage match between Sale Sharks and defending champions La Rochelle from the Salford Community Stadium - it's the last round of pool matches before the knockout stages get underway, and this is therefore a crucial game for both teams as 2022-23 Gallagher Premiership finalists Sale play host to the two-time champions. The last time these sides met was at the quarter-final stage in 2021 when La Rochelle beat Sale 45-21.
