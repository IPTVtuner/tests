Billy Connolly: My Absolute Pleasure is a follow-up to It's Been A Pleasure, which marked Billy's decision to step back from stand-up after a remarkable comedy career spanning over 50 years. One year on, Billy invites us to spend time with him in his newly adopted home of the Florida Keys, where we get a freshly filmed welcome into the life he leads now.
