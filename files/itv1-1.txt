On the farm with Alan this time are dancing legend Darcey Bussell and iconic broadcaster Johnny Ball - Camilla Bassett-Smith brings a riot of colour with a flourish of spring florals for our gardens, we meet some very adorable rescue dogs, DIY pro Wayne Perrey shows us how to make a beautiful garden bench-meets-planter, and Rebecca Apley has some springtime-inspired gin cocktails in the Best of British drinks feature.
