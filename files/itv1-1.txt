Join Katie Piper and enter the space she's created for people to come and reset, retreat, relax, have some fun and hopefully learn some stuff along the way in - this is a one-stop shop for wellness needs, fitness, food, entertainment and celebrity access. As Katie and her guests submerse themselves into different activities in the glorious British countryside, there are also surprises with lots of furry friends and a look at guests of honour that are doing incredible things in their communities.
