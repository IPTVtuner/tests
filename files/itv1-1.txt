Zoe Ball hosts as the judges are joined by West End legend and Mamma Mia! leading lady Mazz Murray - with a personality as big as her talent, Mazz is the perfect person to help the judges decide who has got what it takes to star alongside her and take on the role of her daughter and son-in-law in London's West End. There is also a very special message from Hollywood favourite and star of the Mamma Mia! films Dominic Cooper.
