In this episode, Fred's cycling route on the north coast of Northern Ireland takes him through dramatic cliffs, rolling hills and lush forests - Fred tries his hand at golf for the first time in Portrush, which is gearing up to host the 2025 Open, and the sport doesn't stop there as he also gets a lesson in hurling, the fastest field sport in the world.
