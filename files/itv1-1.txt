Using first-hand testimony from past inmates and staff, the second documentary in this series tells the truth about life behind the walls of Wormwood Scrubs, one of Britain's most notorious jails. It includes the story of superspy George Blake's 1966 escape from the Scrubs, which had a long-lasting impact on the prison system as a whole.
