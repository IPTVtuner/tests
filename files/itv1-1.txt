James Martin's British adventure travels as far to the east of England as this journey will go, to Norfolk, where he is joined by his good old mate and top local chef, Galton Blackiston. They meet in Cromer, where Galton has a successful fish and chip shop, which inspires James to cook pan-fried cod with a warm tartar sauce on the beach. Then James heads to Norfolk Lavender to find out why it grows so well in this county and how it's distilled for oil.
