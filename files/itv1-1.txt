Holly Willoughby and Stephen Mulhern host the semi-final as the four remaining celebrities battle it out for a place in the Grand Final - however, they face the solo challenge and must take to the ice entirely on their own if they are to get there. The legendary Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean head up the judging panel as usual alongside dance supremos Oti Mabuse and Ashley Banjo, and Ashley also performs a thrilling routine with Diversity.
