In stifling Edwardian London, Wendy Darling mesmerises her brothers every night with bedtime tales of swordplay, swashbuckling and the fearsome Captain Hook. However, the children become the heroes of an even greater story, when Peter Pan flies into their nursery one night and leads them over moonlit rooftops through a galaxy of stars and to the lush jungles of Neverland.
