Today, May 11
Alan is back and is joined on the farm by musical theatre icon Elaine Paige and popstar-turned-clergyman-turned-author the Reverend Richard Coles - we also say hello to some incredible birds of prey with falconer Alan Greenhalgh and get a lesson in dog grooming before Chris Hull shows us how to create a magical secret garden with a few top tricks and Andy Clarke sends off the show in style by bringing us some delectable musical-inspired martinis in honour of Elaine.
