Ed Chamberlin and Francesca Cumani present coverage of racing from Ascot and York - today's feature race is the King George at Ascot featuring some of the top mile-and-a-half horses in training competing for one of the top summer prizes. There's also some excellent racing at York including the Group Two York Stakes where the winner could head to the Juddmonte International later in the summer of 2024.
