Paul explores Kent's beautiful forests - in fact the county is number one in England for the most ancient woodland. Covering over 10 percent of Kent's bucolic countryside, Paul meets the people, and animals, who thrive in this stunning backdrop. Paul escapes to the Wildwood Trust just outside Canterbury - a wildlife conservation centre helping protect some of Britain's most endangered animals.
