Today, February 18
A TV reporter blames God for the worst day of his life, not expecting him to then bestow his divine powers upon him to see if he could do a better job. At first, he uses his omnipotence for personal gain, but then comes to realise that one of his main duties is to listen and answer peoples' prayers. Turmoil ensues as he tries to give everyone what they want, at the same time as trying to win back his neglected girlfriend.
