Ed Chamberlin and Francesca Cumani present coverage of four races on the opening day of Glorious Goodwood 2024 - the highlight of the day is the Goodwood Cup over two miles where some of the stars from the Ascot Gold Cup could line up in this year's renewal. Chief supporting races include the Vintage Stakes for juveniles and the Lennox Stakes over the specialist trip of seven furlongs - analysis comes from Jason Weaver and Leonna Mayor.
