Prue Leith, her husband and friends cook more mouth-watering dishes and explore the joys of their Cotswold home and local area - in this episode of the programme, Prue welcomes 'The Voice of an Angel' Charlotte Church to the kitchen and cooks up her twist on one of Charlotte's favourite dishes of yakitori chicken. Charlotte talks about why she set up a mindfulness retreat in the Welsh countryside and thrills Prue by singing a song before she leaves.
