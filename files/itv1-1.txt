When Kathy and Martin's teenage son Noah goes to a beach party during a family holiday, little do they know their world is about to turn upside down. Accused of a serious crime he denies committing, sixteen-year-old Noah is supposed to be sitting exams and spending the summer having fun before college, but instead he faces years in a Turkish prison, thousands of miles from home.
