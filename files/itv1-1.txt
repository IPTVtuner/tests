What could be cosier than Ainsley rustling up some winter warming dishes? The nights are getting longer, and so Ainsley has sought that comfort food that keeps us warm and toasty. Ainsley starts with a hearty beef and red pea stew with thyme spinner dumplings. He is joined in the kitchen by Strictly Come Dancing Royalty Anton Du Beke, who deserves top marks for his rum and raisin bread and butter pudding. Jeremy Pang shares his lamb rendang recipe.
