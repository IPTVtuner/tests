Startling revelations emerge about the ties between a past crime and the present crime - but is Kate Lawson guilty of her niece's murder? The legal system is tested by the jury's process of deliberation - how can twelve people with diverse problems and morals judge the fate of another? This question is raised - and the group's individual flaws are challenged by the least likely among them. Sequestered in a hotel, their conflicts and personal connections are put under a microscope.
