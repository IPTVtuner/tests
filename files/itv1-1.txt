James is bringing his culinary tour of the UK to his neck of the woods as he spends precious time in his adopted home county of Hampshire. He's taking his gun dog Cooper to a training session at Laverstoke before cooking an amazing seasonal dish of partridge with vegetables and a sloe gin sauce. James hangs out with his best friend Jody Scheckter, an ex-formula one racer with an epic car collection, and a surprising passion for buffalo mozzarella.
