Parallel coming-of-age stories of a layabout `serial nice guy' living a posh, carefree lifestyle off his deceased father's fortune, and a bright but awkward youth who's tired of his mother's depressed, boyfriend-less state. Their paths collide when the boy fabricates a two-year-old son and joins a group called S.P.A.T. (Single Parents Alone Together).
