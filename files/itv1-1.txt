Joining Alan at Manor Farm this time are Anita Dobson, Tom Allen, and Amol Rajan to provide the cheer and the chat - horticulturalist Camilla Bassett-Smith opens the pages of her summer diary, we catch up with the brown bears currently residing at Jimmy's farm, Andy Clarke has the best in festival drinks and nibbles and we have a spot of camel racing too.
