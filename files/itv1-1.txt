Ed Chamberlin presents coverage of the world's most famous horse race - the Randox Grand National - from Aintree as 34 runners line up to be the 2024 winner. The runners include 2023 winner Corach Rambler, who looks to be the third horse after Tiger Roll and Red Rum to win back-to-back renewals - after dominating at Cheltenham, the Irish team headed by Willie Mullins look to have a very strong chance of winning this year's race.
