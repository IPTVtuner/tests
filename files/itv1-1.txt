Ainsley's Mediterranean exploration continues on the Italian island of Sardinia. His first stop is the rather glamorous beachside Ristorante La Spigola for a taste of chef Roberto's modern take on Italian dining, before being immersed in a truly classic Sardinian culinary experience, cooking suckling pig over an open fire on the beach. There's a pasta masterclass with the wonderful hosts Erica and Alessandro, who teach Ainsley how to make a uniquely Sardinian pasta shape called Jiusoni.
