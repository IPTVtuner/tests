Mark Chapman and guests provide highlights and analysis from the day's three Premier League games, including Liverpool's first home game under new manager Arne Slot. Slot replaced Jurgen Klopp earlier this summer, and he takes charge of his first league fixture at Anfield against Brentford. Liverpool lost just once in front of their own fans in the top flight last season.
