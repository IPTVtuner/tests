Maya is a newborn elephant calf, just hours old. She is the newest arrival in Samburu National Reserve in Kenya. It is the rainy season, food is plentiful and there is something of an elephant baby boom. But Maya and her first-time mum Zadie face many challenges: Firstly, Zadie needs to reunite with her herd so she can learn how to look after her newborn baby; then they must avoid hungry lions and the guns of poachers.
