Louise Minchin, Julia Somerville and Gloria Hunniford hear from victims of severe flooding who've been forced to move out of their homes for months because of delays in carrying out repairs, which they say were caused by their insurers. Also on the programme, the homeowners tied into solar panel contracts they say are impossible to escape, and a viewer contacts the team about a premium bonds win that she says can't be cashed in.
