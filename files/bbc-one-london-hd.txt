Today, September 15
Live coverage of the third and final T20 international between old foes England and Australia at Old Trafford. This is England's first series in this format since they reached the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup in June 2024. A host of new faces have been included in their squad as they look to the future, with stalwarts such as Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali replaced by the likes of 20 year-old pair Jacob Bethell and Josh Hull.
