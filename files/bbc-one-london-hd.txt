A historic day arrives for Euro debutants Georgia, who play their first match at a major tournament, taking on TÃ¼rkiye in Dortmund. Mark Chapman presents the action. The Georgians booked their place in Germany with a tense, penalty shoot-out victory in a play-off versus Greece in Tbilisi. Coached by former France international Willy Sagnol, their star man is Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, while goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili has enjoyed an excellent season at Valencia.
