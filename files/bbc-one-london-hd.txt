It's the second leg of a week-long road trip with glass lover Mark Hill and silver specialist Margie Cooper. They're racing along in a 1980 MGB Roadster, each with Â£200 to splash around the (not so sunny) Yorkshire coast, from Bridlington to Pickering. Mark rolls the dice on a Victorian board game from Germany, while Margie makes a mess with some antique cosmetics.
