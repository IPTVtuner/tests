Steve Brown is on a property-hunting mission in Surrey today, with a buyer who has a budget of Â£500,000 to find the space she needs for her and her dog. Keen to help out in the community, Steve also takes her to visit a Grade One-listed cemetery, where they meet a group of volunteers who keep the graves and grounds in tip-top condition.
