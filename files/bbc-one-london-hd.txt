Women's rugby union as England host France at Kingsholm. The Red Roses will have happy recent memories of facing Les Bleus, having beaten them in the Six Nations in Bordeaux in April, clinching a third successive Grand Slam. In fact, England haven't lost to France for six years in all competitions, so they will be looking to extend that run ahead of the visit of New Zealand in their next fixture.
