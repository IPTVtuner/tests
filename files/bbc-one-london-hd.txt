Mark Chapman introduces highlights from the day's two Premier League matches, featuring four teams all hoping to qualify for European football come the end of the season. Unai Emery's Aston Villa side travel to the capital to take on Tottenham, while Manchester United host Chelsea at Old Trafford in a game that finished in a 2-1 victory for the home team in 2023-24, thanks to two goals from the now-departed Scott McTominay.
