After winning The X Factor in 2009, Olly Murs went on to become a megastar, selling out arenas worldwide. It's been a roller coaster journey, but Olly always returns to his home in Essex. He says people presume he's from Essex, but he's actually a quarter-Latvian. His late grandfather Eddie was from Latvia, but Olly knows very little about this side of the family and wants to find out more. Olly starts his research by visiting his father, Pete.
