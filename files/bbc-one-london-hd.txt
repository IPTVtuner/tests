First getting to work first is expert Will Kirk, who has an appointment with an 1890s knife-sharpening barrow and its custodian, Emilio. He has brought the barrow with a request that this important piece of family history can be transformed from the now broken and rusted condition. The barrow originally belonged to Emilio's great-grandfather, also called Emilio, who took up the trade of knife sharpening in a small village in the Dolomite Mountains before setting off to seek his fortune.
