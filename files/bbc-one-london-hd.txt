Watch live coverage from a crucial contest in Group A as Scotland continue their Euro 2024 campaign against Switzerland in Cologne. Prior to this tournament, Scotland had won just two matches across their previous three appearances in these finals, including a group stage triumph against Switzerland on home soil in 1996 - although Ally McCoist's winner was not enough as the Scots exited on goals scored, following Patrick Kluivert's late consolation for the Netherlands against England.
