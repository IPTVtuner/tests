Mark Wright and his team, Tommy Walsh and Maxine Dwyer, help Max, a young man with Sotos syndrome, create a calmer and more accessible home. Max's bedroom, filled with collectibles, was overwhelming for him. The team declutter the room and adjust his desk for better comfort. In the bathroom, a new partition and safer fittings offer privacy and accessibility. Finally, an awning and lavender trellis in the garden transform the outdoor space into a relaxing retreat for Max to enjoy.
