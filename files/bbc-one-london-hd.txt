Jeanette Kwakye and JJ Chalmers are across the morning's action on day six, where British rowing royalty and mother of three Helen Glover is seeking a third Olympic gold medal. Cornwall's Glover has been tipped for success in the women's four after taking gold at London 2012 and Rio 2016 in the pair with Heather Stanning. She will line up alongside Belfast's Rebecca Shorten and Olympic debutants Esme Booth and Sam Redgrave in Paris, with the quartet unbeaten heading into these games.
