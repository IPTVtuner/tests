Romesh Ranganathan is back hosting The Weakest Link. Eight Eastenders cast members show off their general knowledge skills to win money for their chosen charity. Each round, one player will be voted The Weakest Link by their fellow contestants and will leave with nothing. Who will bank up to Â£50,000 and who will do the Walk Of Shame back to Albert Square?
