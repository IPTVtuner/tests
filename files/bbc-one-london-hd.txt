Up at the safari drive-through, keepers have discovered worrying lumps on the stomach of Olivia, one of the Grant's zebras. They fear they could be tumours, so the vets want to take a closer look. However, to do this Olivia will need to be separated from her young daughter. Zebras form very close bonds, and as they have never been apart, it could be extremely distressing for them both. The bond between the keepers and their charges is vital.
