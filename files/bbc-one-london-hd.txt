Hoping to take home the Â£10,000 jackpot this week are friends Ann and Steven from Paisley, couple Khamisha and Jack from London, and best friends Ella and Alex from Brighton. They'll face four rounds of fun and frantic pictures - including the brand new Picture Twist and buzzer rounds - and will need to shout out anything from 'Eiffel Tower' to 'a cauliflower'. It's a game where anyone can get involved, so get ready to shout along with them!
