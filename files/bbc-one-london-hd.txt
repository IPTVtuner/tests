A family home is targeted in an arson attack - and two people die. But the matches found at the scene are damp and only give a partial DNA profile. There's nothing to put the main suspects at the scene until an eagle-eyed detective realises there's something wrong with the CCTV footage. Also, police hunting for a burglar who's stolen hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of jewellery get their moment of proof from a distinctive piece of clothing.
