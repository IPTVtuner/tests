We follow the team in control and crews out on the road across Greater Manchester as they care for people in the places they call home. Filmed in 2023 in the north west, one of the areas hardest hit by the cost-of-living crisis, the ambulance service increasingly acts as a vital safety net for those struggling to cope. It does this while also working hard to deliver emergency care to over seven million people living in the region, amid some of the darkest times in the NHS's 75-year history.
