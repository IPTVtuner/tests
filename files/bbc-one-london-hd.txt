Nigel Havers welcomes five more sellers to the Bidding Room, where they try to sell items to professional dealers who are on the lookout for interesting pieces, with help from expert Simon Bower. First through the doors is Kasha, with a piece of 1970s nostalgia - a wind-up toy monkey who plays the cymbals. Next, Peter has a set of highly polished samovars for sale. Tash is intrigued, but will she be willing to bid what Peter is expecting?
