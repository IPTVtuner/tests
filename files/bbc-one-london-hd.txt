Nigel Havers welcomes sellers of collectables and curiosities to the Bidding Room's new home in Edinburgh, where they ply their wares to five dealers. First through the doors is eight-year-old Braxton with his granddad Graham - they've brought a friend in the form of 6ft golfing statue, 'Bob'. The statue has presided over Graham's garden for many years, but the time has come for Bob to be rehomed.
