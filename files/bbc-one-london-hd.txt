Tahera, Rubina and Ghazala are charming, opinionated and determined ladies from Yorkshire, with one major thing in common - they're all Asian aunties, women who use their lifetimes of experience to impart wisdom, pass judgement and glue their communities together. This engaging and insightful documentary follows this trio of Bradford women as they embark on their latest mission - to ensure their language, food, music and values are handed to the next generation.
