Fiona Bruce and Philip Mould head to the beautiful Essex countryside on the trail of one of the 20th century's greatest artists, Dame Elisabeth Frink. They're investigating an intriguing sculpture that owner Amanda Kirke discovered at her local car boot sale. Amanda's initial search on the internet, brought up a similar looking figure titled Small Warrior, produced by Elisabeth Frink in an edition of ten in 1956, one of which was once owned by David Bowie.
