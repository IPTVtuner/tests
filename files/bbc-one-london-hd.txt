Jeanette Kwakye and JJ Chalmers host a busy morning of live Olympic action, with Team GB in the hunt for medals across multiple sports on day eight, including rowing and equestrian. The British rowers failed to win Olympic gold in Tokyo for the first time since 1980, and the men's and women's eights will be looking to put that right this morning in Paris. Great Britain's dressage team have reached the podium at the past three games, with gold in London, silver in Rio and bronze in Tokyo.
