First through the doors is children's entertainer Stuart, with some apparatus to delight the dealers. His three pairs of stilts have been part of his act for the past 15 years, but the time has come for Stuart to move them on. Next in is Jana, hoping for a glass-half-full attitude from the dealers. Her art deco perfume bottles were inherited from an aunt who lived to be 103. Third to arrive at Edinburgh HQ is Sharon from Norwich.
