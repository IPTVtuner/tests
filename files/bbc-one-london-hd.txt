Ben Fogle and Kate Humble are back for another glorious summer series following the incredible lives of the exotic animals at Longleat Safari Park and the keepers who care for their every need. There was shock last year when a surprise family turned up at the park and established a home. Beavers started building a lodge on Half-Mile Lake alongside two hippos, half a dozen sea lions and a couple of big boats.
