It's the final week of the heats, and tonight four more chefs don their MasterChef whites to confront two demanding tasks. Those that hit the MasterChef standard might just find themselves in the last quarter-final. Marcus gets things underway as he challenges the first two contenders in a tricky skills test. On order today is pan-fried plaice, a beurre blanc sauce and shoestring fries.
