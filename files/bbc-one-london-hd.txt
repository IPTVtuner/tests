Join Mark Chapman for the best of the action and reaction from Anfield, where old adversaries Liverpool and Manchester United meet in their opening game of the year. Liverpool outclassed Manchester United at Old Trafford to win 3-0 early this season, and it's less than two years since they routed the Red Devils 7-0 - a record scoreline in this fixture. Relegation-threatened Ipswich travel to Fulham in the day's other Premier League fixture, while there's a recap of Saturday's action too.
