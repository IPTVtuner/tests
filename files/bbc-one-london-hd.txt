Gloria Hunniford, Louise Minchin and Julia Somerville hear from viewers who say their carefully packaged goods are getting smashed by clumsy couriers. The team in HQ put packaging to the test. Also on the programme, a customer of a leading car retailer who was involved in an accident says it was caused by problems with a newly bought motor. And the Italian restaurant owners who say they were ripped off by a company claiming it could get them a discount on their business rates.
