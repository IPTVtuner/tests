An ex-boyfriend throws acid into a young woman's face, then uses a series of disguises in an attempt to throw police off the scent. But number plate recognition cameras help prove he was in the area and responsible for the horrifying attack. Meanwhile, a new online system is set up in Cumbria, enabling witnesses and victims of crime to upload video evidence and send it direct to the police.
