The Kelso Ram Sales on the Scottish Borders is one of the largest and oldest ram sales in Europe, with more than 3,500 sheep expected to be sold on the day. Charlotte Smith joins local farmer Anne Mair-Chapman as she prepares her prized animals for the big event and meets the farmers buying the all-important ram that will help their flocks flourish over the next year. She also goes behind the scenes to see how this massive market is organised.
