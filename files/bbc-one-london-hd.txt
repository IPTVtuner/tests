Nigel Havers welcomes three more sellers to the Bidding Room, where they try to sell items to professional dealers who are on the lookout for interesting pieces, with help from expert Simon Bower. First through the doors is 'Cuba Steve', with an unusual but beautiful object saved from an old theatre. Will the dealers realise what it is and be prepared to part with their cash? Next is Sujit, with a piece of artwork by a famous British artist.
