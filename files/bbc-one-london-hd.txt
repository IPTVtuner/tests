Barbara has sold her home and downsized to a caravan to keep the men in her life happy. Initially she was speaking to Frank Wadsworth, whose chaotic life in Ghana saw Barbara send him over Â£150,000 to help out. Then, out of the blue, she was contacted by Danny, who claimed to be a different man but over time has taken another six-figure sum from Barbara. Kym and Ashley want to draw a line under this horrific chapter in Barbara's life.
