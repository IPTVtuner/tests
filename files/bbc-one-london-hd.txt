Christina Trevanion and Will Kirk take their mobile auction to sunny Somerset. They're here to help Lucy and Jeremy declutter and downsize to nearby Frome, but it's going to be quite a challenge. There's not only their packed cottage, but also an adjoining barn rammed full of collectables to investigate. While restoration expert Will scours the house for items of furniture in need of a fix, Christina uncovers some art in the barn.
