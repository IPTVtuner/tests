Passionate gardener Sonia is finding her garden more of a challenge since her recent eye condition has worsened. Hoping for a garden that reminds her of her favourite cottage garden, Lee and Charlie battle it out to win her favour. This time, it's Lee's design that wins, but his new garden must include Sonia's hexagonal hut, also known as the Gin Palace and her hot tub. Lee decides to complement them with another hexagonal water feature and a pergola that covers the hot tub!
