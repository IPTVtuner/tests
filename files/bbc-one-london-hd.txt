Gabby Logan introduces another colossal clash as Wales host pre-tournament favourites France at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff. The Welsh have endured a bruising campaign so far, although they came close to pulling off the biggest comeback in Six Nations history against Scotland in their last home Test. Warren Gatland's men are currently on a five-match losing streak at home in this tournament, their worst run in this competition since it began in 2000.
