The roadshow is at Swanage Pier and seafront in Dorset on England's south coast, where treasures include a rare Omega watch that was run over by a lawnmower - but does expert Richard Price think it's worth saving? Duncan Campbell is amazed by the best silver item he's ever seen on a roadshow, a tiny teapot by a renowned maker, while a group of three stunning diamond jewels makes John Benjamin's day.
