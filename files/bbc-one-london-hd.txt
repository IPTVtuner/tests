In England's smallest county, Rutland, a couple from Buckinghamshire with a budget of Â£500,000 ask Steve Brown and the team to find them a detached property with a garden big enough for a vegetable patch. Continuing the horticultural theme, Steve visits Barnsdale Gardens to see for himself the legacy left by one of the country's best loved gardeners, the late Geoff Hamilton.
