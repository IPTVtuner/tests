The roadshow is at Pitzhanger Manor in Ealing, west London, where finds include a quirky 18th-century 'Harlequinade' children's flip book, a vintage trainer collection and a flying helmet from the Battle of Britain. Alastair Chandler comes across a unique pocket watch that symbolises a family's story on the eve of the Second World War, and Jon Baddeley is enthralled by the story behind a medal awarded to a suffragette.
