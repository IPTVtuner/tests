When an organised crime gang start bringing large quantities of drugs into Crewe, police need to crack down on them, but the gang's methods make it painstaking work to uncover who they are. Surveillance of one man links him to the kingpin, and police are able to then bring down the whole operation. Also, when burglars force their way into a vicarage and viciously attack people inside, it's one brave victim's memory of an unusual tattoo that gives officers their moment of proof.
