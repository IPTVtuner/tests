On duty at Bermuda's international airport is officer Paul Watson. The subtropical island has strict laws on the importation of narcotics, and the British-born Bobby known as 'Geordie' works alongside airport customs to keep the airport free of drugs. But with 800,000 passengers flying into the island each year, it's never easy. Officers stop a suspicious group of young people and discover one of them is carrying a vape containing THC, the active ingredient in cannabis.
