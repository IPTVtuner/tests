This groundbreaking film features the charismatic creatures of Asia's oceans, never-seen-before spectacles and brand new animal behaviour. From ocean giants in the big blue to tiny fish that climb trees, squid that glow in the dark and grey reef sharks in their hundreds, Asia's waters are as spectacular as they are diverse.
