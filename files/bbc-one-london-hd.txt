Ardingly in West Sussex is the location for today's programme. Christina Trevanion is in charge, with experts Nick Hall and Ochuko Ojiri helping the red and blue teams spend Â£300 looking for treasures. Christina looks at the history of English jigsaw company Victory Games. As usual, the teams face profits and losses at the auction, but which team will come out on top?
