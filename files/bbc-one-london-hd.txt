All eyes are on the capital in this week's edition of the Premier League highlights programme, which features two London derbies, including enigmatic Tottenham's clash with an improving Chelsea. In today's other derby, Arsenal were aiming to continue their title challenge at Fulham and gain revenge for a 2-1 defeat at Craven Cottage in last year's campaign. You can also see what happened when Leicester City hosted Brighton and Bournemouth travelled to Ipswich Town. Mark Chapman presents.
