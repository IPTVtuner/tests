The lives of the park's rock hyrax babies hang in the balance as their mum is taken to the vets for an urgent medical investigation. The keepers have spotted worrying lumps on the mum, Dozy, which might be affecting how her youngsters feed from her. With Dozy at the vets, the babies are alone, so it's a race against time to do the investigation and get mum back to her babies before they get too hungry.
