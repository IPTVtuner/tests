On a sultry summer day in 1935, a Sussex garden simmers with tension between maid's son Robbie and wealthy young Cecilia. Indoors, her jealous sister Briony watches and writes stories. When her drama isn't performed, Briony invents a more vivid tale and a lie that sends Robbie to prison and, eventually, to war.
