Chris and Charlie go head-to-head, redesigning a garden for a family who love art and upcycling. Claire and James's garden contains an art studio at the back, which Chris's design incorporates, while Charlie turns this area of the garden into an art-inspired gravel garden. Meanwhile, Chris's pièce de résistance is a crazy-paving patio and path made from old broken paving slabs. With a mini pond and elegant love seat thrown in, it's not long before the family have the garden of their dreams.
