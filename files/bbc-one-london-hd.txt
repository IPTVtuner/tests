Alistair Appleton is on a property-hunting mission to the beautiful Cotswolds, with a couple who want a location with dog walks on the doorstep, as well as decent dining options for date nights! Away from potential houses, Alistair visits another young couple who turned their backs on town life to rent on the rural edges of the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, where they can indulge their passions for photography and gardening.
