Auctioneer hotshots Raj Bisram and Hettie Jago bounce into the counties of Berkshire and Hampshire. Their chariot is the mighty 1979 Cadillac Sedan Deville. Hettie stays true to her beloved jewellery and buys a bevy of necklaces and a brooch, but goes off track when an anatomical model of an eye catches her, ahem, eye. Meanwhile, Raj is scooping up everything from an old rugby ball to a 1920s wedding veil.
