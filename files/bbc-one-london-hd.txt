20-year-old Alexander McCartney, already known to police, is arrested and his devices seized after a 12-year-old girl in Scotland reports a serious catfishing abuse incident online. McCartney gives a 'no comment' interview while in custody and without enough physical evidence to charge him, he is released on bail. Back home at his parents' house, McCartney's bail conditions are supposed to prevent him from using devices that can connect to the internet.
