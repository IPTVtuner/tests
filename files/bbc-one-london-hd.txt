Upcycler Jay Blades is at Walsall recycling centre in the West Midlands on a mission to rescue and revive unwanted items. With four eclectic skip finds to transform, Jay turns to upholsterer Leigh-Anne Treadwell to get creative with a swivel chair, while designer/maker Daniel Heath tackles a sideboard. Woodworking wonder Bruce Faulseit has a drop-leaf table to transform, while Jay takes on a bedroom chair as his own creative project. But will all four transformations be a success?
