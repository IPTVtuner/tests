Swimming again takes centre stage on the third evening of competition, with high expectations of British success in the men's 200m freestyle - one of five finals in the pool. Great Britain earned 200m freestyle gold and silver at the Tokyo Olympics, but reigning champion Tom Dean didn't even make the team this time around. Duncan Scott will attempt to upgrade his silver medal from 2021, but teammate Matt Richards is the current world champion. Presented by Clare Balding.
