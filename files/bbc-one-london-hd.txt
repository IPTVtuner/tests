Martin is in Stoke-on-Trent to see a mid-terrace that hasn't quite made its mind up about how many bedrooms it has. Martel heads to Chatham in Kent to see a former barn with planning permission for an interesting conversion. She's also in Grimsby to see a three-bed mid-terrace, though she struggles to be optimistic about it.
