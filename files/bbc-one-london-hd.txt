Hoping to take home the Â£10,000 jackpot this week are couple Matty and Harvey from Manchester, mother and daughter duo Emilie and Kathy from Swansea, and friends Patsy and Dave from London. They'll face four rounds of fun and frantic pictures - including the new Picture Twist and buzzer rounds - and might need to shout out anything from 'Jackie Chan' to 'frying pan'. It's a game where everyone can get involved, so get ready to shout along with them!
