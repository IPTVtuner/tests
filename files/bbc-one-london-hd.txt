Jules Hudson is in the Welsh county of Powys with a couple whose property wish list includes an annexe for their parents, along with at least half an acre of land for their budget of £650,000. Jules also meets a man who scours space with his telescopes, looking for large, undiscovered objects that could be on a collision course with Earth.
