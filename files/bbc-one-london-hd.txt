A London couple are swapping the sound of the Bow bells for cow bells, as Jules Hudson helps them to spend their Â£500,000 budget on a house with a music room and a dog-friendly garden in the Derbyshire countryside. Whilst there, they meet one of the county's silver bands, and Jules works up an appetite as he harvests some delicious mushrooms cultivated in an old converted mill.
