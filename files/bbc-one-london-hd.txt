From aircraft to racing cars, military vehicles to spaceships, model building has come a long way since plastic kits and glue were a regular sight on the kitchen table.

The red and blue teams are hoping to craft a profit of their own as they shop for bargains at an antiques fair at Oswestry Showground.
