Never mind about stairs up to the bedrooms, where's the front door?? Dion has to figure it out in a three-bedroom mid-terrace in South Yorkshire. Tommy is in east London to deal with a 'knotty' problem in the garden at a one-bedroom flat. And Martel is in Darlington to navigate her way around a nicotine-stained terrace.
