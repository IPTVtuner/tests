A London-based couple want to escape from the city to carve out a new life in either Somerset or Devon, where Briony May Williams has the keys to some wonderful countryside properties. Briony also meets up with some former Londoners who converted an old cowshed into an exceptional, self-sufficient, family home with spectacular views across the Axe Valley.
