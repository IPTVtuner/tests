Alex Scott and guests preview an exceptional weekend of games, including Liverpool v Manchester City in the Premier League, England's women against the USA and the FA Cup second round. Liverpool have lost only one of their past 21 home league matches against reigning champions Manchester City and have made a superb start to the season under new head coach Arne Slot. Emma Hayes has also made an immediate impression in charge of the USA women's team, leading them to the Olympic title in Paris.
