There's a mystery arrival at the park who is changing the landscape in Wiltshire. There are tell-tale signs by the lake: felled trees, gnawed branches and changed waterways. The keepers have their suspicions about what may have caused this, so have set up hidden camera traps to try to solve the mystery. Also, the keepers test Jean's knowledge of animal poo as she finds out why knowing the difference is so important.
