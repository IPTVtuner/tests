BBC ONE London HD
Today, October 19
Playing this week are married couple Stewart and Ross from Glasgow, couple Amy and Anwar from London, and uncle-niece duo George and Danielle from Liverpool. They'll be taking on four fun and fast-paced rounds - including the brand new Picture Twist and buzzer rounds - that could throw up anything from historical figures to album covers. It's an addictive quiz for the whole family - you'll find it hard not to play along from home as well.
