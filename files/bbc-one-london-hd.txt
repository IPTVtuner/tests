A skilled expert witness does more than just analyse existing evidence. They guide detectives towards new clues that can turn a case. That is what happened in the case of Lynette White, where a forensic scientist helped police locate new evidence to find the real killer after five men had been wrongfully arrested for the crime. Our next case reveals how forensic analysis of fragments of CCTV footage blew apart a suspect's alibi and identified him as the killer. It is a rule in police investigations that the more elaborate the alibi, the more suspicious it is. During the investigation into the murder of office worker Cathy Marlow, the prime suspect claimed he was elsewhere being mugged at the time. As alibis go, it was an unusual one, and detectives had a hunch something wasn't right. It took an expert witness, though, to show that their suspicions were correct.
