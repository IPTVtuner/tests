On the morning of 27 January 2023, Nicola Bulley is walking her dog along the River Wyre in the quiet Lancashire village of St Michael's on Wyre, when she disappears without a trace. The question of what has happened to her transfixes the nation. The 45-year-old mortgage adviser and mum of two seemed to have no reason to disappear, so where has she gone? To add to the mystery, her dog is running loose, and her phone is still on a Teams call.
