In a jam-packed season finale, one of the most monumental stories unfolds with Rusty the Amur tiger. He and his sister Yuki thrilled the keepers when they were born in 2019. They were the first tigers to be born at the park for years, and we have followed their every step, from feeding from their mum to their first time exploring their enclosure. These tigers are the largest of the species and are part of a vital international breeding programme.
