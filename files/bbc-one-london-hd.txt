Ginny Buckley meets a couple of Londoners who have a massive Â£1million to spend on a detached property in the Essex countryside with lots of space for family and friends. On a break from the house tours, Ginny visits a farmer who has found that the county's unique climate has enabled him to grow a crop usually found much further afield.
