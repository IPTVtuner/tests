A couple from Bedfordshire with a budget of Â£450,000 need Ginny Buckley's help in Norfolk to find them the first house they are buying together. They would like a character property with a good-sized garden for some new canine companions. Ginny also heads to Great Yarmouth, where she straps in for a white-knuckle ride on one of the country's last remaining wooden rollercoasters.
