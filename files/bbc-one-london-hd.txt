First through the doors of is Alison with some 1950s swimwear. The swimming costume and sunglasses hold fond memories for Alison of her late mother, but the time has come to move on some of her possessions. The collectability of vintage clothing may come as a surprise to Alison, but the dealers should see the value in the fashion items. Which one of them will dive in first? Next to arrive is Bill, with a piece of military history.
