Martin is in Port Talbot, West Glamorgan, to see a two-bed mid-terrace that has literally been stripped back to brick. Tommy is in Stoke-on-Trent, where he visits a terraced property that has issues relating to being rather close to an old mineshaft. Jacqui is in Folkestone, Kent, to see a top-floor one-bed flat with a great view that could prove to be an ideal holiday let.
