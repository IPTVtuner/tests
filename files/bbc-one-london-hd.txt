At the fennec fox enclosure, Zuri has just given birth to a litter of three kits. This should be a cause for celebration, but past problems with Zuri's pregnancies put the keepers on high alert. Darren, the head of animal operations, decides that the keepers should intervene and attempt to hand-rear two of them. Can they do enough to keep them alive? Meanwhile, out in Wolf Wood, Kate gets the ride of her life when she joins carnivore keeper Kayleigh in the 'feed wagon'.
