Gary Lineker introduces the goals, drama and best reaction from the weekend's Premier League fixtures, including the London derby between West Ham United and Arsenal. The Gunners secured their biggest Premier League away win in February with a ruthless 6-0 dismantling of West Ham, who suffered their heaviest home defeat in the division. The Hammers made a slow start to the current campaign under new head coach Julen Lopetegui, but Arsenal also have some catching up to do in the title race.
