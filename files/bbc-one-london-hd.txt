The live tennis coverage at London's famous Queen's Club continues, with some of the world's best players competing in the first women's tournament at the venue for more than half a century. Russian-born Olga Morozova was the last title-winner back in 1973, and there are a host of big names aiming to succeed her as the champion at the iconic venue. They include Madison Keys, an American who picked up her first Grand Slam title at 2025's Australian Open.
