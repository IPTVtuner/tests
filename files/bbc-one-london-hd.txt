Hazel Irvine introduces another high-octane afternoon of Olympic action with hockey, weightlifting and track cycling taking centre stage in the French capital. The women's hockey semi-final opens up a jam-packed afternoon before weightlifting crowns a men's 61kg Olympic champion. Over at the velodrome, the men's sprint and women's keirin continue in the early stages, plus the men's and women's team pursuit will both crown their champions too.
