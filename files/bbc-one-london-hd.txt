Briony May Williams teams up with a retired Shakespeare scholar who wants to write a new chapter in the Cumbrian countryside for her Â£300,000 budget. Away from the house hunting, Briony visits a young couple who made their own country escape and now have a farm with over 100 acres in a tiny Cumbrian village, where they herd sheep with their beloved sheepdogs.
