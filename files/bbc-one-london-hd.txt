Poor old Marie - her small garden with its high walls and boring lawn is so imposing, it's more of a prison yard than a pretty plot. In fact she'd rather have a traditional cottage garden than what she has. But the Garden Rescue team are undaunted, and Chris and Lee want to release her from her brick nightmare! After Marie chooses Chris's design. it's on with turning the new build plot into a bit of country charm.
