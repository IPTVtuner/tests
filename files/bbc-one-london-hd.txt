Clive heads to the heart of southern Italy, where the sun shines brightest but foreign tourists are relatively few. Driving his red Fiat down the same roads as Daniel Craig's Aston Martin, Clive discovers how the James Bond franchise helped turn an abandoned town into a world heritage site, finds out why Puglia is the gay holiday capital of Italy, and learns to play in a traditional pizzica band.
