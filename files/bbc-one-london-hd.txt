Nigel Havers welcomes sellers of collectibles and curiosities to the Bidding Room's home in Edinburgh, where they ply their wares to five dealers. First through the doors is chef Laura with a 1950s étagère, a tiered table for display. Next in is Richard with a pendant light he found at a flea market and haggled hard for to buy at a good price. Arriving at Edinburgh HQ next is retired calligrapher Davina. She was gifted some silver napkin holders found in a charity shop in Canada by a friend.
