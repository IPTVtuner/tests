Living a few miles from Belfast is just too far from family, so now they've retired, today's couple want to move back to England, to Herefordshire, where Briony May Williams shows them what the beautiful county has to offer. Briony also meets another couple who have already made their escape to the area, to an old mill-house and garden which they have opened up to the public.
