Every May, around 100 motorcycle road racers from across the world make the pilgrimage to Northern Ireland to take part in one of the sport's fastest and most dangerous events - the North West 200. Racing on closed public roads at speeds in excess of 200 mph, the riders dice with danger and even death. To outsiders, it looks like a form of madness. To those who do it, it's like their religion, and the road their church.
