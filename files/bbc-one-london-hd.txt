Martin is just outside Tonypandy, South Wales to see a three bed mid terrace, bought unseen by a relatively inexperienced developer. He's also in Sheffield, South Yorkshire to visit a large, derelict, five bedroom property riddled with dry rot, but with great development potential. Jacqui is in Herne Hill, London to see a four bedroomed, three storey end of terrace with tonnes of character and lots of opportunity to add value.
