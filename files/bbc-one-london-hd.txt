As we join the weekend shift in north east London, crewmates David and Lex are booking on for the day, when they're interrupted by a paramedic panic alarm blaring out on the open radio channel for all to hear - an ambulance crew have been attacked while treating a patient. As the team in dispatch send help to the crew in distress, David and Lex arrive to their first patient of the day - a 59-year-old female with difficulty in breathing.
