Gary Lineker presents comprehensive live coverage of a mouthwatering clash in Group C as England face Denmark in a repeat of their thrilling semi-final at Euro 2020. When the two nations met at Wembley three years ago, England ended a 55-year wait to reach a major final as captain Harry Kane's 104th-minute goal - scored from a rebound after Danish keeper Kasper Schmeichel had saved his penalty - proved decisive.
