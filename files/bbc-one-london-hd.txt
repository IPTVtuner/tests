The roadshow returns to Cromford Mills in Derbyshire, where treasures include a collection of rare football shirts, a brooch found in a sock drawer and a quirky bird clock. Joanna Hardy is captivated by a platinum brooch that has been languishing in a sock drawer for years, and Hilary Kay gets a kick from seeing a mule-themed money box. Will Farmer unleashes a greyhound figurine from one of Staffordshire's best-known pottery studios, while Justin Croft discovers a rare 18th-century journal.
