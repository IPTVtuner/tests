In Surrey, Sarah Moore is at Witley recycling centre, trawling the car boots in the hope of finding some potential gems in need of creative magic. Upcycling sisters Katie Stone and Sophie Lawrence are tested by a wooden cabinet in disrepair, four chairs in a mix of styles get a radical revamp from woodworker Martin Hough, whilst Sarah must think out of the box when she takes on a metal trunk full of vintage tools.
