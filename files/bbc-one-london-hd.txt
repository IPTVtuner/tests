Live coverage of the eagerly anticipated Group F game in Leipzig as Euro 2016 winners Portugal take on a Czech side who were finalists in 1996 and semi-finalists in 2004. This game could see Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo create yet more history by becoming the first man to feature at six European Championships. The 39-year-old already holds the record for most games and goals at the tournament. The Czechs have been championship ever-presents since their split from Slovakia in 1993.
