Denise Nurse and Alistair Appleton reunite with homebuyers they first met in 2012. Denise guided newlyweds around Wiltshire as they aimed to escape London for a life in the countryside. Fast-forward, and she is delighted to discover that one of the fantastic properties she showed them has really stood the test of time. Then, Alistair turns back the clock, revisiting a former Escape mission in Bedfordshire. But he ends up finding his house-hunters happily settled in a rural home 200 miles away.
