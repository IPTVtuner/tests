Join Clare Balding for live coverage of the ladies' singles final at Wimbledon to catch every ace, smash and drop shot on Centre Court. Last year, the Czech Republic's Marketa Vondrousova beat Ons Jabeur of Tunisia, who was appearing in her second successive Wimbledon final. The last six finals have produced six first-time winners, including Elena Rybakina, Ashleigh Barty and Angelique Kerber - two of whom entered the grass court tournament this year.
