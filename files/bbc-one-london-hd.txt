Fasten your seat belts and get ready for take-off as Bargain Hunt celebrates the world's first supersonic airliner.

Eric Knowles boards the last Concorde to be built and reminisces about its three decades of aviation history, including the Ã  la carte menu and the seats designed by Terence Conran.
