There's an urgent need for Alistair Appleton to find today's buyers a new home in stunning Shropshire, as they have just sold their current house in Essex. For their budget of Â£375,000, the couple would like a detached property with a big kitchen for baking and a large garden for growing fruit. Alistair also visits a sustainable Shropshire flower farm and attempts to design a wedding bouquet.
