In a Holidays special, Gloria Hunniford, Julia Somerville, Louise Minchin and the team hear from customers of a leading holiday cottages company, who say their getaways were wrecked when they found their holiday homes covered in grime. Also on the programme, the online travel agent that left holidaymakers paying much more than they bargained for, and how declaring mental health conditions can leave you paying through the nose for your travel insurance policy.
