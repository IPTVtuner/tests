JJ Chalmers is at Wallyford recycling centre on Scotland's east coast hoping to uncover three lucrative items amongst the skip-bound trash. He enlists the help of sign-writer Joel Poole for a creative design on a glass-fronted cabinet, whilst upcycler Sarah Peterson turns her attention to a radical makeover on an old wicker trunk. Meanwhile, JJ sets himself the challenge of turning a pair of wooden doors into a potential profit.
