A soon-to-be retired vicar and her husband need Sonali Shah's help to find a new home in the beautiful countryside of Gloucestershire. Sonali also visits Adam Henson, who, as well as being the nation's favourite farmer, is also the custodian of his father's legacy - a farm dedicated to the conservation of some of the rarest livestock breeds in the world.
