Lions Klaus and Simba are getting old, and some of the females in their pride can sense weakness, which could easily turn to violence as they fight for the top spot. The long-term plan for keeper Caleb is to retire the boys so that they can live a quiet life together - but first, he needs their help to solve another problem within the pride. A weaker female called Zuri is being picked on by the other more dominant girls, and if she is driven out of the pride, her life could be in danger.
