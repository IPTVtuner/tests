Gabby Logan introduces live action as Wales and Italy meet at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff in both teams' final match of the 2024 Six Nations. The last time they were on Welsh soil, the Italians ended their seven-year, 36-match losing streak in the championship with a stunning 22-21 victory. The surprise loss for Wales ruined the occasion of Alun Wyn Jones winning his 150th cap for his country. Both sides have struggled in the Six Nations since.
