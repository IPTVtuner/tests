Auctioneers Raj Bisram and Hettie Jago are cruising the roads of Suffolk in a 1979 Cadillac. Our gal shows that she's a mean stilt walker, so Raj buys a pair after Hettie daringly demonstrates. But Hettie keeps to her specialism, buying jewellery hot contenders. On a visit to rural Essex, they discover the roots of witchcraft and the tale of witchfinder general Matthew Hopkins. Can Raj cast a spell on the auction?
