A feud is brewing in the meerkat enclosure at Longleat, and it's a family affair. Meerkats live in strict hierarchical groups, and elderly female Cassie appears to have been ousted by her daughter Harley. This act has left the mob of meerkats in a terrible disarray because none of them are sure of their position within the group. To try and bring them together and allow them to work out their pecking order, keeper Charlie has a plan.
