Gary Lineker presents highlights from the day's seven Premier League matches, featuring Arsenal against Brighton and West Ham United v Manchester City. Arsenal did the league double over the Seagulls without conceding last season, including a 2-0 triumph at the Emirates, while City also defeated West Ham in both league meetings - the Blues' 3-1 triumph on the final day was enough to secure a fourth successive Premier League title.
