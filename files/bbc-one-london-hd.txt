Based on Edith Nesbit's book about three children whose lives change dramatically after they move from a comfortable townhouse to a small Yorkshire cottage near a railway line. Their mother is forced to make the move after their father was wrongly imprisoned, but the children, ignorant of the circumstances, soon settle into their new home, enchanted by the countryside and enthralled by the railway.
