Adyan has never had a garden before, but now she is married to Araam, she has her hands on one for the very first time. Unfortunately, its main features are a long strip of concrete leading to nowhere and a six-inch-high barbecue! Charlie and Lee go head-to-head to win the couple over. Getting the concrete strip out is the first challenge for the team, but once that's done, the winning plan comes to life. The team add a pergola that incorporates a swing, a barbecue area for Araam.
