Charlie Dimmock takes on the Rich brothers in a challenge to design a Mediterranean wildlife haven in Bristol. Homeowners Jill and Rob have a large, disordered and overgrown garden that is desperately in need of some TLC. The sun-loving couple want to transform it into an urban suntrap reminiscent of their holidays in the Mediterranean, complete with large sun deck, a wildlife pond and exotic planting.
