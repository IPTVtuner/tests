Gary Lineker is joined in the studio at Ewood Park by former Blackburn and Newcastle legend Alan Shearer as the two sides meet in the FA Cup for the ninth time in 29 years. Newcastle have advanced from all five ties against Rovers during that period, although three went to a replay - including the most recent meeting, which the Magpies won 4-2 away after extra time in the 2018-19 third round. With no replays held at this stage of the competition, the winner must be decided on the night.
