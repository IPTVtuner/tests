Jules Hudson savours the spectacular scenery and splendid isolation on offer in Scotland's Caithness, as he helps a young family with a house-hunting budget of Â£270,000 to realise their dream of self-sufficiency. Whilst there, Jules learns about the life of a crofter with a tenant farmer whose ancestors have lived and worked on the same land for generations.
