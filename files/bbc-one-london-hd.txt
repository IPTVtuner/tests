Gary Lineker introduces highlights of the day's seven Premier League games, including the London derby between Tottenham and West Ham. The Hammers enjoyed the bragging rights last season after taking four points off their bitter rivals, including a famous 2-1 victory away at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Elsewhere, title-chasing Arsenal travel to Bournemouth, Southampton take on fellow-promoted side Leicester and Fulham host Aston Villa.
