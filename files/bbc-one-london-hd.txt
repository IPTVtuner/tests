Jeanette Kwakye and JJ Chalmers will navigate through a busy morning for Team GB, which begins in central Paris as the much-anticipated women's triathlon gets underway. Great Britain's Georgia Taylor-Brown had to settle for silver in Tokyo three years ago after suffering a cruel puncture on the bike leg of the race. This year, she'll be competing alongside compatriot and world champion Beth Potter and Olympic debutant Kate Waugh.
