Clive has visited Rome with his wife Catherine and his mates, as well as for the BBC - this time, he heads out of the centre and up one of the city's seven hills to the rarely visited neighbourhood of Monteverde, where he talks football with a butcher and puts his Caribbean cooking knowledge to good use. He also comes to the surprising realisation that if he ever moves to Rome, he'll likely take up cricket.
