Two men are lured to a spot in Cambridgeshire under the pretence of a business meeting. But they're kidnapped, threatened with weapons by masked men and forced to transfer a large amount of the company's money. Police need to unpick a complicated web of phone calls and CCTV to find their moment of proof. And a couple who become ill after eating curry are found to have been poisoned. With one person dead, police are hunting for a murderer.
