Join Alex Jones and Sir Lenny Henry for a rollicking, retrospective romp celebrating Sir Lenny's epic 37 years hosting Comic Relief. From the very first night of Comic Relief in 1986 at the Shaftesbury Theatre - and the first live show on the BBC in 1988 - until this very evening, one man has been at the wheel. We will reflect, reminisce and wallow in one last laugh along with Len on the Comic Relief stage.
