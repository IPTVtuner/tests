Eric Knowles presents from The National Botanic Garden of Wales in Carmarthen. Kate Bliss and Ben Cooper are guiding the reds and blues, who have three hundred pounds to spend on three items that will hopefully make them a profit at the auction in Cardiff. Eric also chats to ceramic artist Jonathan Cox, whose work is inspired by the Welsh countryside.
