Christmas is coming, but before the family can fully get into the festive spirit, Joe and Stacey have to get their work commitments wrapped up. Joe's got a starring role in panto, and Stacey is shooting a TV ad. Friday night dinner is a chance to reconnect with the family before the season properly kicks off with a visit to a Christmas tree farm and the family celebrations, which go off with a bang.
