In Surrey, Sarah scours bootfuls of rubbish at Witley Recycling Centre in the hope of finding some gems among the junk. There's a bad luck bureau which screen printer Daniel Heath hopes to turn the tables on, a Chinese coffee table is lifted to new heights thanks to carpenter Bruce Faulseit, whilst Sarah tries to find a use for some battered old horse handbooks, but will she sell any of the items for a profit?
