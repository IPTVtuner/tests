Christina Trevanion and Will Kirk take their mobile auction and workshop to Northumbria. It may be England's least densely populated county, but it's got an awful lot of clutter. Not least at the home of Mike and Carole, two retired schoolteachers who are desperate to downsize. But will they be able to let go of several treasured items and heirlooms? With a grandchild on the other side of the world, monies raised from the auction will fund a much-desired trip abroad to visit.
