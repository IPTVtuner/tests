Hazel Irvine hosts another action-packed afternoon in the French capital, with diving and track cycling providing the headlines. In the velodrome, Great Britain won the inaugural Olympic women's madison title in Tokyo, but Laura Kenny has since retired, and Katie Archibald misses out because of injury. The new cycling taliswoman is Emma Finucane, who's in action this afternoon in the early rounds of the sprint.
