Nicki Chapman heads to rural Hampshire to help a couple with Â£700,000 in their pocket find a permanent country home where they can finally kick back and relax after a life of relocating because of work. As a keen rider, Nicki also meets a master saddler and her daughter who are key to the survival of this traditional craft, and then takes the reins and tries riding side-saddle for the very first time.
