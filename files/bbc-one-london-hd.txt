Gabby Logan introduces live action from the Principality Stadium as Wales and Scotland get their Six Nations campaigns under way. Both sides will be desperate to secure an opening victory in Cardiff that would see them lift the Doddie Weir Trophy. When they met in last year's tournament, the Scots ran up a record score against their fellow Celts, winning a one-sided encounter 35-7. That victory also saw Scotland end their hoodoo against Warren Gatland, which had seen them lose 11 Tests in a row.
