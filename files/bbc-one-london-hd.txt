In the first leg of their journey the boys drive across the Andalusian region of the country. After a very dramatic arrival in a hot air balloon, Anton and Giovanni touch down just outside the region's capital city, Seville. Armed with his Spanish mother's list of places to visit, it's not long before the boys hit the city famed for its beautiful weather and relaxed vibe. Anton and Giovanni's first stop is the Plaza de Espa√±a.
