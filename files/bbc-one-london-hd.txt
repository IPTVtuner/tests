DJ Target and Krept and Konan launch the latest search for the UK's next rap star. For the first time ever, a duo is among the artists competing for Â£20,000. After a solid first challenge, the artists prepare a track about an issue close to their hearts, but a domino effect causes some issues with the performances resulting in a unique ranking session and a serious warning about what's to come. Guest mentor is Rimzee.
