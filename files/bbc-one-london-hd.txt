First through the doors is small business owner, Charlotte. She's selling a vintage sign that she bought at auction for a nominal sum. Often seen at village fetes, Charlotte hopes her retro piece will charm the dealers to dip into their own pockets to give her the money she hopes to raise for a charity close to her heart. Next through the doors is a familiar face, Mark, who has returned with a field telescope that hasn't seen further than the inside of a drawer for many years.
