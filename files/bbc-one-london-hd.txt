Alisha and Toby are fed up with their sloping garden that has nowhere for them or their pet rabbits to enjoy. Chris and Flo must come up with a design that's both boho-chic and bunny-friendly! Key to the design is one of the biggest pergolas the team have ever built. It's so big, it needs to be anchored to the wall. While Chris manages that and the giant bespoke bench going underneath, Flo is on rabbit duty, creating a play area for the other garden owners.
