JJ Chalmers and Jeanette Kwakye introduce the morning action at the games, including athletics and gymnastics, after Great Britain attempt to retain the triathlon mixed relay title. The British team were impressive winners of the inaugural mixed relay Olympic gold medal in Tokyo, and Georgia Taylor-Brown and Alex Yee are back from that quartet to aim for a repeat. At the Stade de France, British pole vaulter Molly Caudery will expect to successfully negotiate qualifying.
