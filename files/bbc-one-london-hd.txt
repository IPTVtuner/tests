The barn welcomes Anthony from Norwich with a very rare model car for the attention of Brenton West. The gold-plated model of the Lotus Esprit, the submarine car, was one of only ten made for the premiere of the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977, and was presented to his father, Michael. For Anthony, the car represents his father's rise from humble apprentice to CEO of one of the most recognisable car brands in the world.
