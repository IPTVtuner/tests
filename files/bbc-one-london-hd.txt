Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Bicycle restorer Tim Gunn is the first to receive his project - a trusty yet rusty tricycle, wheeled in by Dorothea Stevenson and her daughter Katie. Father Christmas delivered it to Dorothea over 60 years ago, and it has been enjoyed by generations of children.
