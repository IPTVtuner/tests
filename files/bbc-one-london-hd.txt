When Christian and Catherine moved from London to Shrewsbury with baby Olive, they brought a Victorian house with a completely overgrown garden. They have cleared the garden out, but it is still messy and dull. Catherine is an opera singer and Christian a comic book artist, so their home is full of cool style and bold colours, and they want Charlie and the Rich brothers to add touches of that to their garden - not to mention creating a fairy glen for Olive too. Their budget is Â£5,000.
