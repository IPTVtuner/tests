Jules Hudson is in Derbyshire with a recently married couple making an epic location shift, swapping the Blue Mountains in Australia for the wilds of the Peak District. They have a significant budget of Â£750,000 and have their hearts set on a character home with a large garden for their three dogs. Elsewhere, Jules comes across an unlikely centre of manufacturing nestled in the county's rural countryside.
