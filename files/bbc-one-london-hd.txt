Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Today's first arrival at the barn is a not just a cherished family possession but also an account of survival in the face of adversity. This Jewish prayer book belonged to Gary Fisher's Austrian grandparents Emanuel and Gisela. They were unable to leave Austria after it was annexed by Germany in 1938 and were eventually sent to Theresienstadt concentration camp.
