Live coverage from the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, as the 76ers, led by star man Joel Embiid, host the Cleveland Cavaliers in an Eastern Conference clash. The Sixers are one of the oldest franchises in the NBA and have a rich history of Hall of Famers, but they haven't won the NBA title since 1983. Their opponents Cleveland have enjoyed their fair share of success over the past decade.
