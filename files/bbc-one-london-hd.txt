Defending Olympic diving champion Tom Daley is among the British athletes going for gold on what promises to be an enthralling third morning of the games in Paris. Great Britain's eventing team are also seeking a second successive Olympic gold, while it's another busy morning of heats in rowing and swimming. Daley won a memorable gold medal alongside Matty Lee three years ago in the synchronised 10m platform event and only returned to competition last December.
