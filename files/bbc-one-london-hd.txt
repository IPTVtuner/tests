Thorn the giraffe is an elder statesman of the park and has a reputation for a fiery temper and grumpy demeanour. But as animals get older, they come to rely on their keepers more. Thorn is having problems with his hooves, which have become overgrown. For the vet to get close enough to treat Thorn's hooves, the keepers need to train Thorn to lift his foot on command.
