The pilgrims are on the tenth day of their journey, with 65km still to go before they reach Rome. The route takes them through an isolated and overgrown wood which is a total revelation to Mehreen, who's never experienced anything quite like it before. The group arrive in Sutri, a medieval town with an even older history. They visit a magnificent Roman amphitheatre, and the pilgrims don't hesitate to take centre stage.
