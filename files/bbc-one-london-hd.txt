In Brixton, south London, a man's body is found in the bushes of a park. He is identified as 44-year-old Mauricio Nascimento, who was homeless at the time of his murder. According to the pathologist, it is the most vicious attack he has ever seen - Mauricio has been kicked and stamped to death. Detectives from the Met's murder investigation team must find his attacker. The murder took place in an area used by rough sleepers and not covered by CCTV, usually a vital tool in police investigations.
