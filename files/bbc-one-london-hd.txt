As the headline piece for this year's Red Nose Day campaign, four brave female celebrities head to the Arctic Circle to take part in Comic Relief's coldest ever challenge. Laura Whitmore, Alex Scott, Sara Davis and Vicky Pattison will attempt a four-day, 50km polar expedition that involves climbing thousands of feet as they circumnavigate the Markusfjellet Peak, using fatbikes, snowshoes and cross-country skis, and pulling everything they need behind them on sledges that weigh over 20kg each.
