Expect a T-riffic episode with Charlie Ross as he comes face to face with a dinosaur. Titus, the fossilised skeleton of an adult male Tyrannosaurus rex, is the showpiece at Wollaton Hall, a museum and country house dating back to the 1580s. Titus was found in the Badlands of Montana in 2014, brought back to Nottinghamshire and re-assembled by conservator Nigel Larkin. In neighbouring Derbyshire, two teams face a mammoth task as they compete to make the most profit at Caroline Hawley's auction.
