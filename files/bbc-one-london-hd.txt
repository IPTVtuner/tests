In a scams special, Gloria Hunniford, Julia Somerville and the team reveal how fraudsters are using social media to pull on our heartstrings with fake stories about missing people and pets, before changing the posts for more sinister ends. We also uncover the alarming case of a car sale that went horribly wrong, when scammers posing as buyers pretended to pay via bank transfer but had really used a stolen cheque.
