Roo Irvine quizzes fairgoers with another mystery object on Bargain Hunt from Oswestry Showground. As members of the public puzzle over its use, two teams dash around the stalls buying three items to sell at auction. In red, it's nurses Sheena and Yvonne, and guiding them is their expert, Philip Serrell. Over with the blues, Ben Cooper has his work cut out keeping the peace between sisters Rachel and Elaine. Which team will conquer at the auction near Wrexham?
