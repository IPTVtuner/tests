On the lookout for a property with potential for a holiday let business, as well as a home, Jules Hudson shows off a gloriously sunny Cornwall to today's entrepreneurial couple. Jules also tours a disused china clay quarry, where work has begun to create a sustainable and inclusive garden village by building over 1,000 energy-efficient homes.
