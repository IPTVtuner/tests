Nicki Chapman catches up with past house-hunters who have found a better quality of rural life near the coast. First, Nicki meets up with a couple she went house-hunting with back in 2016. Having ditched their fast-paced lifestyle in search of tranquillity in the country, she finds out how their new seaside setting is suiting them. Later, she looks back at an emotional property search from 2019 when a buyer purchased one of the houses from Nicki's line up.
