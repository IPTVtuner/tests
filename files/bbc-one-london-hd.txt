Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Master cobbler Dean Westmoreland is put through his paces when Neil Scott and his granddaughter Saadia arrive with a custom-made pair of running shoes, complete with metal spikes on the soles. Neil wore these racing spikes in countless running events throughout his life. He began running in the 1940s and twice won gold at the Amateur Athletics Association 100 yards event.
