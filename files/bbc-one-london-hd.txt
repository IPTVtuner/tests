Kiell Smith-Bynoe welcomes the four semi-finalists into the sewing room as the judges set three challenges inspired by design icons. First up, master pattern cutter Cristobal Balenciaga is the inspiration for the Pattern Challenge, as the sewers recreate a version of one of his dresses. In the Transformation Challenge, taking the lead from the iconic Jean Paul Gaultier, the sewers are given a pile of neck ties and tasked with using them to create a brand new garment.
