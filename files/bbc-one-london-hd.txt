It's the third leg of our road trip showdown with mid-century expert extraordinaire Mark Hill and queen of silver Margie Cooper. They brave breakdowns and the brisk weather of the Yorkshire Moors in a 1980 MGB Roadster as they make their way from Darlington to Barnard Castle, each armed with Â£200 to spend on antiques along the way. Mark falls for the charms of the art deco period and - surprisingly - a cast iron sign for a slop water closet.
