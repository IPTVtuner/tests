It's the end of heat three, which can only mean one thing - time for another stress-inducing quarter-final, featuring the week's three best celebrity cooks. The celebrities need to prepare a two-course dinner party feast, which will be enough to satisfy three specially invited guests. The diners are 2021 semi-finalist Su Pollard, 2019 finalist Vicky Pattison and 2017 champion Angellica Bell.
