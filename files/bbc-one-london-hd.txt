Ross Kemp has his hands full as he presents this quiz, where a team of celebrity drag queens, featuring The Vivienne, Tia Kofi, Kitty Scott-Claus, and Lawrence Chaney, get together to take on the Bridge of Lies for their chosen charity. One by one, they face the bridge, which has 32 potential steps - 22 truths and 10 lies. They must only step on the truths, avoiding the lies, earning money for each correct answer.
