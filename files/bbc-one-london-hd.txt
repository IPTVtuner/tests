We've reached the tipping point in the epic antiques battle between good chums but fierce rivals, Natasha Raskin Sharp and James Braxton. In this episode, they find themselves deep in the Black Country, with only their wits, 200 pounds and the contents of James's harvest jug to see them through the day. As they hit the emporia of the West Midlands, James is distracted by sweets, but he still manages to find an enormous specimen of a rather famous bird and buy a somewhat noisy antique.
