In Nottingham, we see a Victorian town house with an unusual back garden, a couple hope to transform a dilapidated mid-terrace in Bournemouth, and a one-bedroom flat becomes an ultra-modern two-bedroom in north London. Dion, Martin and Tommy meet the successful bidders as we follow three unique renovations.
