Our Defenders team up with Ed Sheeran's manager to take on the ticket touts making millions of pounds at the expense of ordinary music fans. The National Trading Standards e-crime team discovers one case in which tickets with a face value of Â£75 are being sold for thousands of pounds. In the first prosecution of its kind, two of the most prolific touts are charged with fraudulent trading and end up going to jail. The result is hailed as a victory for ordinary fans.
