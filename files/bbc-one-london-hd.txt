On 26 March 2024, a 1,000-tonne container ship, the MV Dali, crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. Tragically, six people lost their lives, the Port of Baltimore was closed indefinitely and an iconic piece of Baltimore's skyline was destroyed. In the immediate aftermath of the collision, rescue teams combed the site for survivors, a salvage operation led by the US Army, Navy and Coastguard swung into action, and investigators raced to gather evidence for what caused this.
