Jonnie Irwin takes in the delights of Derbyshire with a couple from Leeds, who, with their fantastic budget, want to see a range of rural properties with all the trimmings. Jonnie takes time out to visit a repair caf√© where, over a coffee and slice of cake, environmentally minded customers can take household items to be mended instead of thrown away.
