Today, August 20
Kari has been training hard for a dance competition, but Barry hasn't at all. Can some last-minute training make him the perfect partner for Kari's routine? We meet one Treasure Champ who is working hard to play the ukulele, and another enjoys a day out fruit picking in order to make ice cream. And storyteller Gemma tells us a story all about finding hidden treasure in a field.
