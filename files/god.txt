Kari is looking forward to going rowing with Barry, but he's changed his mind and goes to the playground instead. But it starts to rain and Barry regrets his lack of loyalty. Thankfully a gust of wind lifts Barry high into the air and plops him into Kari's boat that is doing circles on the lake. They row to an island and watch a rainbow, agreeing that things are best experienced together.
