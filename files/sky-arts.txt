A jewel is missing from a museum and Sherlock Holmes tries to find the thief as bodies pile up across the city. Holmes is sure that the crime is the work of Giles Conover, and the recent string of murders suggests that the criminal, having stashed the pearl alongside the belongings of an unsuspecting Londonite, has ordered a henchman to find it. With Dr Watson at his side, Holmes finds himself in mortal danger as he closes in on his man.
