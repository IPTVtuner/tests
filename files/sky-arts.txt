The Chieftains Water from the Well Journey with the Chieftains to the special places and people of the home counties that form the band's musical soul. Derek Bell, Kevin Conneff, Martin Fay, Sean Keane, Mat Molloy and Paddy Moloney tell the tales of their earliest memories of Irish music. Their thoughtful and often amusing stories capture the emotion behind the scenes of every performance.
