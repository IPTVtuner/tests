On 22 November 1981, in the middle of their mammoth American tour, the Rolling Stones arrived in Chicago prior to playing three nights at the Rosemont Horizon. Long influenced by the Chicago blues, the band went to Buddy Guy's club to see the legendary Muddy Waters perform. This unique occasion was captured on camera and has now been restored from the original footage.
