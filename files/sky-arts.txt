When the Pink Panther diamond is once again stolen and a signature white glove is left behind, everyone assumes that famous jewel thief The Phantom, aka Sir Charles Litton, has struck once again. However, Sir Charles is as surprised as everyone else as he didn't commit the crime, but trying to clear his name leads to mayhem as he sets the bumbling Inspector Clouseau on his trail.
