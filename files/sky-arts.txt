The sleuths investigate a series of grisly murders in a small Canadian village called La Mort Rouge during the Second World War. The villagers believe the deaths are the work of a phantom, according to an old legend, and they see things which support this. Holmes and Watson have to prove otherwise, and stop the killer.
