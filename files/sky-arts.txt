A journey through the life of one of the most prevalent female icons: Frida Kahlo. She was a prolific self-portraitist, using the canvas as a mirror through all stages of her turbulent and, at times, tragic life. Guided with interview, commentary and Frida's own words, to uncover that this, however, was not a life defined by tragedy. Featuring key exhibitions and interviews with world-renowned Kahlo curators.
