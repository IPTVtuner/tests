French mobster Philippe Douvier, suffering from a lack of respect in the crime community, orders the murder of Chief Inspector Clouseau, who has been hailed as a genius. After the assassination attempt, a dead body is found in Clouseau's car and everyone - including Clouseau's former superior, Charles Dreyfus, believes Clouseau is dead. Feeling much better, Dreyfus is released from the mental hospital.
