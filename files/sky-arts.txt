As part of the celebration of the Rolling Stones' 50th Anniversary, this film marks the cinematic debut of the band, following them on a quick weekend tour of Ireland in 1965 just weeks after `(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction' topped the charts and became the international anthem for an entire generation. `Charlie is my Darling' is an intimate, behind-the-scenes diary of life on the road.
