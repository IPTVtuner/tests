Who is the best portrait artist in the UK and Ireland? That's the question that this programme tries to answer. The show, with its judging panel, travels to London, Glasgow, Dublin and Cardiff to hold competitions to find each city's top portrait artist. Those four artists then travel to Paris for further inspiration and development, producing one further work during their two days in France's capital city. The four finalists' work is then displayed in London's National Portrait Gallery for a period. In addition to being considered for further projects by the gallery, the winner is awarded a Â£10,000 commission to produce a portrait of author Hilary Mantel that will become part of The British Library's permanent art collection.
