Bumbling Inspector Clouseau is the target of his ex-boss, Chief Inspector Dreyfus. Driven mad by Clouseau's antics, he escapes from the asylum, captures a scientist who creates a city-destroying device and blackmails the world with one demand - kill Clouseau! As the finest assassins close in, Clouseau blithely tries to track down Dreyfus, oblivious to one failed assassination attempt after another.
