In this revelatory documentary, three young people are determined to change our perception of beauty. As there is ever more pressure to look a certain way, Kimran, Lois and Rafi are on a mission to question the meaning of beauty. Kimran is a 12-year-old identical twin. She and her sister are identical in every way but one - Kimran has vitiligo, a skin condition where white patches develop on her body and hair due to a lack of pigment.
