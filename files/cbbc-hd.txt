Ellen and Dad have been roped into taking brattish cousin Anthony on a day out to a local castle. Aunty Pam has asked Ellen to keep an eye on Anthony, keen for them to spend some quality time together. However, when Mirror-Belle arrives and insults Anthony, Ellen must find a way to convince her little cousin that Mirror-Belle exists and it was Mirror-Belle who slighted him, not Ellen.
