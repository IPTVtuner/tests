When Millie overhears Mum and Mike discussing a holiday in France, she contrives an invitation for herself and Lauren too. But maybe she should have waited to find out the details first. She tries to play Mum and Dad off against each other in the holiday stakes, but ends up with an epic fail for Lauren, Craig, and most of all, herself.
