Blue Peter is turning 65 years old! Don't miss our party in the studio as we challenge former presenters Matt Baker, Lindsey Russell and Radzi Chinyanganya to some fun and games. Joel and Abby take on a whitewater rafting challenge, a BP superfan goes behind the scenes to find out how the show is made, and a whole host of famous faces wish BP a happy birthday!
