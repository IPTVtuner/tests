Waffle is unwell. He's in his pyjamas and under strict orders to stay in bed and rest. But poor Waffle can't get comfy. When he sees Evie and Simon playing in the garden, he feels left out and begins to woof and woof. Simon tells Waffle to rest quietly, but it's too late. The wonder dog's incessant barking has already disturbed Mrs Hobbs next door and, to make matters worse, like Waffle she's not feeling well either.
