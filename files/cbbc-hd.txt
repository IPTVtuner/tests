Ben is a plumbing obsessed fourteen-year-old boy, slowly getting used to life without his beloved cabbage-obsessed Granny around. She loved scrabble and was also an international jewel thief known as the Black Cat - the original Gangsta Granny, a secret that only Ben knew about. When world famous treasures like the World Cup, the Mask of Tutankhamun, and the Queen's Wax Figure at Madame Tussaud's are stolen and the clues point to none other than the return of the Black Cat.
