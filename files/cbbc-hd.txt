Waffle isn't allowed at school, so he's being looked after by Connie, the Brooklyn-Bell's neighbour, at her house. Connie has dressed as a dog and made a huge, doggy maze game from cushions and suitcases for her dog, Jelly, to race through with Waffle. The first to reach a squeaky pig toy wins it. Bad dog Jelly refuses to go through the maze and shortcuts by leaping over it instead, beating Waffle to the prize.
