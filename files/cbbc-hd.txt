The Brooklyn-Bells are on holiday with Gramps, so Waffle is staying at Angela's dog kennels for a couple of nights. During a face-to-face call with Waffle, the Brooklyn-Bells check their wonder dog is settling in and ensure he has his favourite snuggly toy with him, PegStar. Angela tries to settle Waffle but he whines, he's missing his Brooklyn-Bell family and looks at their photo on the wall of his kennel.
