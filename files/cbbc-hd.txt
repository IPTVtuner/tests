The Brooklyn-Bells are looking after the kitten from Jess's veterinary practice. When Waffle checks on the kitten, it's not in its bed. In fact, the kitten is nowhere to be seen. The Brooklyn-Bells don't see it disappear into the utility cupboard and through the tunnel to Mrs Hobbs's house next door. When Mrs Hobbs meets the kitten, she mistakes it for her beloved cat George. She falls in love with the kitten and doesn't want it to leave.
