Today, January 30
Ethan sees that Bob and Corey are busy with an assortment of things. When this happens he likes to do something he normally wouldn't get away with. He calls it Yzarcog Day. That's Go Crazy spelled backwards. All he has to do now is find something good. Ethan spends the day trying different things, but nothing works. At the end he digs up a home-made flamethrower, but gets caught by Bob before he can put it to any use.
