In the Gomantong cave system, Steve Backshall encounters thousands of cockroaches and one of the scariest creepy crawlies to go on the `Deadly 60' list, the scutigera centipede. Thousands of wrinkle-lipped bats call this cave their home. It is a truly awesome sight as in their thousands, they leave the cave to hunt for bugs in the night sky.
