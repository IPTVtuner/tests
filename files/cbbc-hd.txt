Foz, Kyan and Lars are climbing a Tepui in Venezuela, with Xuli exploring this amazing place in her Vroomster. Meanwhile, Grandmaster Glitch is lost and looking for his Grimbots in the thick clouds around the Tepui. He flies up and collides with the Vroomster, causing Xuli and him to crash into a sinkhole. With the Vroomster and their radios broken, it's up to them to find a way out together.
