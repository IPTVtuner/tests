Three young artists must create a piece of animal art that shows a horse in motion. For their inspiration day, the artists head to the stables to ride horses. Ricky shows them some tips on how to draw horses in motion, and then they head to a beach to take photos of them galloping on the sand. They then return to the art studio to create their artworks in the given time. But who will Ricky and Sadie pick to go through to the first semi-final?
