when Roy comes to stay at the B&B for a few days, he's concerned Charlie will get him into trouble as usual. Charlie is supposed to be feeding Roy's cat while his mum is away, but instead decides that he might be able to make some quick money by serving up fish and chips in their chip shop. Meanwhile, Louie has a wobbly tooth and is waiting for the tooth fairy to arrive, but will she remember to visit him?
