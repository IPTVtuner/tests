When Kenny and Adam are sent Wild West costumes and a list of challenges, they must do all they can to become top class cowboys. They need to prove who can swing the best lasso, fire a water pistol fastest, and drink the most juice in the bar slide challenge. Yeehaw! Then, once the dust has settled on the Old West, the bros go head to head again... exercising, in a contest to see who can produce the most sweat!
