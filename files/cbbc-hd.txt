Today, December 14
Christmas is coming, but there isn't much in the way of cheer at the flat or at school. Bell is in no mood to celebrate, he is being a proper Scrooge. At school, Bell makes enemies of everyone, he axes the staff Christmas party, there'll be no Christmas lunch for the kids, the secret Santa is cancelled, and he announces that full lessons will proceed as normal. Back at the flat, Jack has some words of advice for Bell, but they fall on deaf ears.
