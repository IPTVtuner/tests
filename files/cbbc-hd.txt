Adventure-loving Jack and Nancy get blown away by the wind to a tropical island. The castaways spend their days exploring this gorgeous new world, having adventures and meeting exotic creatures. However, homesickness soon sets in. Finally spotting a ship on the horizon, they escape the island, returning to their own town and finally realising there is no place like home.
