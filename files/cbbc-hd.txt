Lily gets a part-time job waitressing at Mugshotsz Café, determined to prove to straight-talking owner Lou that teenagers make good workers. However, her mission goes wrong when Jas gets a job at the café too. Jas is messy and thoughtless, which upends Lily's need for perfection, yet Lou thinks Jas is brilliant. Meanwhile, Sid has been invited to audition for a performing arts college.
