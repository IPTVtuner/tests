Max, 9, and Harry, 12, are two brothers who have a shared passion for Goalball, a sport for visually impaired and blind people. The sport is similar to football, except the players are blindfolded and there is a bell in the ball so they can hear it. The boys have ocular albinism, a genetic condition that primarily affects the eyes. It doesn't stop them excelling in this sport, however! Both of the boys love Goalball and when they are older would like to play professionally and represent Team GB.
