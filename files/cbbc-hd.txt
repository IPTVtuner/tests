Stuff is going missing in the leisure centre. As head of security, Joy tasks Mick with getting to the bottom of it. That means spending a night in the leisure centre all alone, or with Danny, Mick isn?t sure what?s worse. Together the boys vow to keep an eye out and get to the bottom of this mystery once and for all. However, with a sleepwalking Joy prowling the corridors it seems like everyone is going to get more than they bargained for in the morning.
