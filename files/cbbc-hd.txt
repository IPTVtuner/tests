Joy is being particularly harsh on the boys - well, they did just spray ketchup on her best and only party dress, so to cheer Mick up, Danny puts on the freshly cleaned dress to do a silly impression of her. When the zip gets stuck and Danny is unable to get the dress off again, it seems like their day cannot get any worse. Which is when Mick gets his tie caught in the dress's zip while trying to unstick it.
