Two bungling alien scientists transport Pidsley and Shaun aboard their flying saucer. Unfortunately, a foolish error causes the aliens to swap the animal's brains around. Shaun and Pidsley are dumped back to earth, not realising they are in the wrong bodies, leading to much confusion around the farm before the aliens return to correct their mistake.
