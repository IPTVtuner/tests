Today, October 23
Bell is excited to be meeting Mrs Morgan (Polly's mum), the new school governor. She's going to confirm him as head, having sorted out all the problems of last year. Or that's what he thinks. But when he gets to `his' office he's appalled to discover Goodman is still here. Once again he's been snubbed, and he's not happy about it! Bell's even more annoyed when he sees the library has been renamed the Eleanor Goodman Library. Meanwhile, Polly's excited about a new term too.
