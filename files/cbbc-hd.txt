Steve and his trusty team head to the frozen north of Norway. He follows the tracks of Europe's largest cat, the elusive lynx, up into the hills in the hope of seeing one, and gets a little nervous when he meets some in captivity. Arctic foxes and musk oxen are also on the menu in this deadly snowy episode.
