Today, December 11
Dan is hosting a special Christmas dinner at the Palais and everyone is invited. Chloe and Nate get to spend some quality time together, while the rest of the band take a well-earned break. Harry and Oakley go shopping for Christmas trees with AJ, which doesn't end well, and Sasha's conversation with Coleen's boss, Ashley, doesn't quite go as planned. And things take a very dramatic turn when Anika receives a surprising and unwelcome letter in the post.
