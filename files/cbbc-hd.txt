Nine-year-old Kiran is a big fan of a certain boy wizard and a bit like his hero, he's had his life turned upside down. He recently changed schools, moved miles away from all his friends and he hasn't complained once. That's because Kiran helps look after his mum, who has a disability which means she has trouble moving around. His mum's condition meant they needed to be nearer to family.
