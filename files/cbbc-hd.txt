Ocean, nine, from Brentwood has had a tough time. His younger brother Sky died two years ago and he needs a place to escape to when things get too much for him. He also has a new baby sister which he's excited about but his house has become pretty noisy! Ocean loves marble runs because they're like rollercoasters and one day he'd like to be a rollercoaster designer. He wants a marble run den where he can get away from it all and work towards his dream.
