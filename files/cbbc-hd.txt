Helena is 11 and an only child. She loves star-gazing, wants to be an astrophysicist when she's older and is passionate about girls getting into science. She lives above her mum and dad's bookshop where they often work seven days a week which means she doesn't get the chance to get out and look at the night sky! Helena needs a den to help her reach for the stars and fulfil her science dreams.
