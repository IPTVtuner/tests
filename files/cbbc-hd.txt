Steve Backshall and Naomi Wilkinson head to the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth for a special science lesson inspired by CBBC's Deadly Mission Shark. In this exciting Live Lesson for 7- to 11-year-olds, we follow in the footsteps of the Deadly Mission Shark Saviours, learning all about sharks, their adaptations and the threats to their survival, before learning how to become animal conservationists.
