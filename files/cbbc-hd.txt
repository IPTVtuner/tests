The OZT brothers are on an adventure to take a closer look at some of Britain's threatened grassland animals. Aaron and Cam go off-road in a bumpy dash across the wilds of Exmoor to try and gather more than 100 semi-wild ponies off the moor for their annual health check. Cam meets 12-year-old wildlife hero and butterfly champion Rebecca to find out why she is so fascinated with butterflies.
