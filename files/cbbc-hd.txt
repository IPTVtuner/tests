Glitch is excited when Lars refits the Grimbler with new, clean biogas boosters that could make it even faster than the Vroomster! The boosters run on gas made from food waste, and luckily there is plenty of leftover food in the academy canteen for the Grimbots to gather up. But Glitch overloads the boosters and BOOM! He loses control of the Grimbler and is sent flying across the academy, out of control.
