Mum and Mike plan a night out, but when their babysitter cancels, they decide to leave the girls with Mike's son Craig. He's their worst teenage nightmare, even though they've just met, and quickly shows them he's in charge. When they eventually get the better of him, they find out he needs to be handled with care, as they could be seeing a lot more of Craig.
