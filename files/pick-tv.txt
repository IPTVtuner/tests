Morgana and Helios have successfully captured Camelot, and Merlin and Arthur are outlaws on the run. Arthur must take control before Camelot is lost forever, but faced with Agravaine's betrayal and the strength of Morgana's force, the young King has lost his conviction. Only Merlin can restore his faith, and only an extraordinary act can prove to the King that he was born to rule.
