Quest
Today, April 05
Today, Henry and his ace mechanic mate Sam Lovegrove are in Surrey where they find Pontiac ambulances, mysterious automotive sculptures, and strangely well preserved motorbikes. Later, in Cornwall, they meet a collector whose cottage is like a transport museum, chock full with memorabilia, penny farthings and lights of all description.
