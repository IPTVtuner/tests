Quest
Today, April 08
First to arrive at the barn, seeking the help of conservator Kirsten Ramsay, are Cyndy and Jack Lessing from Essex. They have brought a ceremonial glass goblet, known as a Kiddush cup, which their family used every Friday evening to welcome the Sabbath. Cyndy and Jack bought the ornate, hand-decorated glass over 30 years ago, as a bar mitzvah gift for their son. However, the goblet was smashed in an unfortunate accident and has been kept in pieces in a box for years.
