Quest
Today, December 24
Woodwork expert Will Kirk is enchanted by a musical jewellery box that miraculously survived a devastating house fire. Pamela Lamb from Devon cherishes this memento, as it belonged to her elder sister Vera, who sadly passed away as a teenager. Pamela still remembers happy times when they would play with the box, but the fire scarred the pretty painted box.
