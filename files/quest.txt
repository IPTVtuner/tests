Quest
Today, March 25
Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Clock connoisseur Steve Fletcher comes face-to-face with a thrilling assignment when Andy Cronk brings in an 18th-century time piece built by renowned French maker Julian Beliard. This rare and prized piece belonged to Andy's grandfather, who obtained it by chance after the Blitz. Andy grew up with the clock as it was passed down the generations, but he's never known it to work properly.
