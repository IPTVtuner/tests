Today, November 01
Blacksmith Matthew Boultwood takes on a piece of British military history: a ceremonial helmet from one of the oldest regiments in the army, the Life Guards. Also forming part of the Household Calvary that provide personal protection for the monarch, this helmet may well have stood guard outside Buckingham Palace during the reign of Queen Victoria. After years in a damp attic Matt has a real challenge to get it back in parade ground condition once again.
