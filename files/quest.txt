Quest
Today, January 01
Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Resident clock expert Steven Fletcher is in receipt of an unusual time piece, a statue of a barmaid holding a swinging pendulum clock dial. These clocks are known for being temperamental but with a good clean and a few replacement parts, Steve has it swinging once more.
