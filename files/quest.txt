Quest
Today, February 28
Peter Mason from Herefordshire has brought in a kitchen curiosity from a bygone age. The old-fashioned ice cream maker belonged to his beloved Granny Ethel and holds memories of happy times at her house. The gadget is falling apart, so Peter hopes metal craftsman Dominic Chinea can salvage it. Lots of fun is had when organ restorer David Burville takes on a Spanish barrel organ.
