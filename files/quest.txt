The episode joins the North West Ambulance Service as the Covid-19 vaccine rollout is beginning to take effect. The service has so far managed to vaccinate 70 per cent of its frontline workforce. A quiet start to the night shift is broken by a 999 call on behalf of a 13-year-old patient who is stuck on a bus having dislocated her knee. She is unable to move and in severe pain, so the crew have no choice but to try to get the knee back in place at the scene.
