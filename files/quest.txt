Quest
Today, December 30
Comedian and presenter Joe Lycett manages to find humour everywhere, but apart from his Edwardian great grandad, a member of the Royal Antediluvian Order of the Buffaloes in Nottingham, Joe uncovers a darker family history. Joe finds out that his two-times-great grandfather Robert Wilkinson was a boy chimney sweep in the 1850s. Joining the Royal Marines, Robert travelled the world, but his involvement in razing villages in China following the Opium Wars leads to alcoholism and a breakdown.
