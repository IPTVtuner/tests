Today, April 13
Resident horologist Steve Fletcher works on a clock that was fashioned from the propeller of a plane that crash landed in France during World War One. Passed down through the injured pilot's family, Steve must get this piece of history working for future generations. Metal expert Dominic Chinea brings his skills to bear on a rusted and seized up shoe stretching machine, one of the few reminders of owner Maggie's parents and their shoe shop.
