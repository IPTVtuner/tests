Quest
Today, April 16
Sarah Moore is rummaging the rubbish at Witley Recycling Centre in Surrey where she's on the lookout for three unwanted items she can save from the skip. Sarah calls on upholsterer Leigh-Anne Treadwell to give a dull brown chair a modern twist while carpenter Ollie Allen is tasked with repurposing a wooden chest. For her own project, Sarah has a mediaeval style tent to contend with.
