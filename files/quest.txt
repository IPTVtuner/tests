Quest
Today, February 18
Cassie and Sue Day from Swindon hope maestro Pete Woods can lend his musical ear and very specialist skills to a cherished brass trumpet that has lost its lustre. For decades this trumpet heralded the new year for Sue's family as her father proudly played it while marching up and down the street. She dreams of resurrecting the family tradition, and Pete pulls out all the stops.
