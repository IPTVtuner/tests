Quest
Today, September 23
Alan Titchmarsh and his team take the garden makeover show to Hemel Hempstead to create a garden for an extraordinary family. Like his wife Sabina, Asif Iqbal was born with no hearing. He told the programme about his admiration for Sabina, who has never seen disability as a disadvantage and has received numerous awards for her voluntary charitable work, including Tesco Mum of the Year 2010. Asif himself is also an inspirational force.
