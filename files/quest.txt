Quest
Today, December 06
In Altrincham in Greater Manchester, Jay Blades is scouring the recycling centre in search of three unwanted items to save and sell on. Designer maker Ollie Allen takes on the challenge of transforming some metal springs, while upholsterer Leigh-Anne Treadwell gets to work giving a new lease of life to an old blanket box. For his own project, Jay has two tables to add some creativity to, but will he succeed in finding new homes for all his upcycled items?
