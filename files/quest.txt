Quest
Today, December 16
Henry and Sam love their tractors, but they've never used one in earnest. They've decided to enter a ploughing competition, which means they need to buy a vintage tractor and plough combo; and then they'll have to learn how to use them. As always, Henry is after a bargain, which means he and Sam have a major rebuilding job to do before they can even contemplate cutting their first furrow.
