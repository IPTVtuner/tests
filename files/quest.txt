Quest
Today, February 18
Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First to arrive is Eleanor Grundell from Leeds. She has her hopes pinned on master goldsmith Richard Talman saving two rings with huge meaning. The engagement and eternity rings were the beautiful possessions of her grandma Edna, whom Eleanor sadly never met but heard so much about from her late father.
