Quest
Today, May 04
In the West Midlands, Jacqui Joseph scours Walsall Recycling Centre for quality items. Her mission is to save three things, have them transformed or revitalised and try to sell them for a profit. She has her sights set on a chest of drawers, there's a much-loved set of six dining chairs for upholsterer Leigh-Anne Treadwell to work on, and signwriter Joel Poole works his magic on a mid-century cabinet.
