The North West Ambulance Service takes over 40 emergency calls for patients in cardiac arrest each day. Call handler Brogan has to guide one caller through the process of performing lifesaving CPR while they wait for an ambulance to arrive. The control team experience a spike in calls concerning patients with breathing difficulties and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This is particularly hard on call handler Sherilee, whose mother suffers from the same condition.
