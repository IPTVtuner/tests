Quest
Today, December 11
Soft toy restorers Amanda Middleditch and Julie Tatchell work their magic on an old teddy called Fred. Fred is a beloved childhood toy but his owner immigrated to Australia many years ago, sadly without Fred. The 50-year-old, threadbare bear is stuffed with his original wood fibre which is not permitted by Australian customs.
