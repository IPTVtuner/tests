Quest
Today, December 28
With his wife giving birth in just a few days' time, Peter Highman is on his way home to LA. Anticipating a straightforward flight from Atlanta, Peter doesn't count on the interference of the oddball aspiring actor, Ethan Tremblay, sitting behind him. Unintentionally implicating Peter in a bomb threat misunderstanding, Ethan manages to get them both thrown off the plane and placed on the airport's blacklist.
