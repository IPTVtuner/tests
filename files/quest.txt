Today, November 11
Art conservator Lucia Scalisi revives an oil painting of a mining scene, created by an amateur artist in the 1960s. It is a delicate task for Lucia as she cleans away the dirty surface to reveal the stunning scene underneath. Owner Gwyn is overwhelmed when she returns to the barn to see her miner father's artwork restored to its full glory.
