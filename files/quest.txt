Quest
Today, November 06
Jay Blades is sifting through the unwanted whatnots at Altrincham Recycling Centre in search of three dump diamonds that he can take, transform and turn a profit on. Upcycler Sarah Peterson's creativity is tested with a tired set of cane chairs, while robot maker Mark Haig's challenge is to come up with a new use for an old video projector. For his own project, Jay gets crafty with a collection of discarded windows.
