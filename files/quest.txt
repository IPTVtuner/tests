Quest
Today, November 15
Series in which Henry Cole and Sam Lovegrove nose around people's sheds and garages in search or automotive bargains. Today, in a Cornish surf shack they find a bevy of custom bikes, surf buggies and weird and wonderful objects of all kinds. In Oxfordshire, discoveries include rare motoring memorabilia,1970s kitsch and a fabulous collection of stationary engines. They come, they see, they haggle, they repair and finally sell for a tidy profit.
