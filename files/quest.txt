Quest
Today, October 06
Sarah Moore is at Woking's recycling centre to stop quality discards ending up in the skips. She intercepts a retro swivel chair, a large oak dining table and a once-cherished sideboard. With the help of upholsterer Simion Hawtin-Smith and screen-print artist Zoe Murphy, the three items are revitalised ready to sell on and hopefully turn a profit for their original owners.
