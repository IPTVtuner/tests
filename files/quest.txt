Quest
Today, December 17
Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First up is a unique and challenging commission for bear repair duo Amanda Middleditch and Julie Tatchell. Dolls Amy and David are the treasured possessions of 36-year-old Jess Hiles. First given to her when she was five, they have been her constant companions through thick and thin for over 30 years.
