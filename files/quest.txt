Quest
Today, March 03
Today in the Repair Shop, Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Metal expert Dominic Chinea takes on a toy carriage which originally belonged to a young boy born in 1911. Owner Jane inherited it from her father and remembers pulling it along and sitting on it as a child. Most of all, she recalls placing her stuffed toys carefully inside. Dom turns his hand to replacing the battered roof.
