Quest
Today, June 10
Series in which Henry Cole and Sam Lovegrove nose around people's sheds and garages in search or automotive bargains. Today, Henry and Sam discover a collection of motorbikes on Bodmin Moor accumulated over 25 years. They snap up a Suzuki B120 but selling it on to Henry's mate means they hardly make any money on it. Later, in Redruth, the pair come across Harry Potter's Ford Anglia. They bid for it and take it home where a buyer is not far away - their soundman Tommy wants it.
