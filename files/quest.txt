Quest
Today, April 12
Series in which Henry Cole and Sam Lovegrove nose around people's sheds and garages in search of automotive bargains. Today, the pair are in Somerset where they discover an amazing collection of Norton motorbikes, Italian mopeds and French go-karts. Moving on to Hertfordshire, they find vintage cars, obscure tractors and rare British bikes from the 1950s. Everything is going well, but when the haggling starts, things don't turn out quite how anyone expected.
