Quest
Today, January 19
Master furniture restorer Will Kirk and auctioneer Christina Trevanion meet 88-year-old Pattie and her daughter Tricia. Forced to downsize after the unexpected death of her beloved husband Ray, Pattie has ended up with all the antiques they collected over the years moved in her new flat. She's hoping Will and Christina can help her declutter her home and raise enough money to visit her friends in Menorca for the first time in eight years.
