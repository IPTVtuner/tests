Quest
Today, September 08
Toy restorers Amanda and Julie have their work cut out reviving a sad dog that has been badly burned in a devastating house fire. The toy has been by owner Jody's side throughout her life, and when she saw her house being engulfed by flames, it was one of the first things on her mind. Now totally scorched, Jody would like her beloved toy to be restored so she can pass it on to her young son Noah.
