Quest
Today, September 29
Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First to arrive is Marcia Bryan, with a precious doll for the attention of toy restorers Julie and Amanda. This dislocated doll serves as a reminder of Marcia's time in a children's home in the 1950s, where she lived with her twin brother from the age of six weeks. As a little girl, Marcia bonded with Diana the Doll as they shared the same skin colour.
