Quest
Today, December 28
An amnesiac schoolteacher discovers she was formerly a government assassin when she hires a low-rent private eye to help fill the gaps in her memory. Together, they go on the run in a race against the clock to stop her former taskmasters from putting a heinous plan into action, before they can silence her for good.
