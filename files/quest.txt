Quest
Today, December 13
Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. A daunting task has ceramics restorer Kirsten Ramsay worried. Jayne Marston has brought in her parent's four-foot-high, heavy stone bird bath in the hope Kirsten can preserve it. For over 60 years, wherever Jayne's family moved the bird bath would follow, uprooted and replaced at the new house with great effort by her dad. Jayne has lost both her parents over the last three years and during a long illness her mum would take comfort watching the birds at the bath. Jayne's mum made her promise to keep feeding the birds and to keep water in the bath, telling Jayne 'whenever the birds are near so am I'. However, the bird bath is now showing its age, and with a huge crack threatening to break it in two, Kirsten's restoration skills will be pushed to their limit.
