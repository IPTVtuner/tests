Today, November 24
First up is a pinball penny slot machine, originally at the bar of a village pub run by owner Jeannine's family. From the late 1930s until the 1950s, her great-grandfather was the landlord at this local watering hole, and was then succeeded by her grandparents. Jeannine was brought up just opposite the pub, and this antique pinball machine now provides a tangible link to her predecessors.
