Quest
Today, March 19
Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Widower Geoff Clark from Sunderland is hoping audio expert Mark Stuckey can restore a beloved jukebox that holds memories of a very special person. He bought the 1960s jukebox over 40 years ago, around the time he met his late wife, Marie. The two shared a love of music and the jukebox gave them both such joy, even providing the entertainment at their wedding reception.
