Today, August 04
Furniture restorer Will Kirk is tasked with repairing a writing bureau owned by Kathryn Lovell and her dad John from Northamptonshire. The bureau belonged to Kathryn's grandfather, who ran the village post office for decades and was loved by all. However, the wood is now warped and split, the desk panel that folds down has suffered a nasty fracture and a main hinge is broken.
