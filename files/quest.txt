Quest
Today, February 27
Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Metal expert Dominic Chinea and wood restorer Will Kirk join forces to work on a very special wooden travelling trunk. It contained all the worldy possessions of a family of Polish refugees as they travelled across continents looking for a new home after the Second World War, eventually arriving in Britain aboard the Empire Windrush in 1948.
