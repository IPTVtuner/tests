Quest
Today, April 19
Series in which Henry Cole and Sam Lovegrove nose around people's sheds and garages in search of automotive bargains. Today, the pair are in the Cotswolds where they discover sheds full of stationary engines, obscure agricultural implements and some very surprising collections of memorabilia. Moving on up to Sussex, they go behind the scenes at one of Britain's most famous bike shops, and find in its dark corners and dusty attics, two extraordinary hidden gems.
