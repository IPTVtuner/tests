Quest
Today, November 12
Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Wood expert Will Kirk is entrusted with a dearly loved wooden soldier's trunk that has been passed down five generations of one family. Now custodian Luke is embarking on officer training at Sandhurst and would like to take his great great grandfather Sidney's military chest with him.
