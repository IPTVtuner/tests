Quest
Today, December 06
In Newhaven, two paragliders face a nightmare on Christmas Eve when they land on an isolated stretch of beach with the tide rising rapidly. At Port St Mary, on the Isle of Man, the crew race to the rescue of a stranded yacht in danger of breaking up on rocks with a crew of three still aboard. Across the Irish Sea, in Barry Dock, a teenage girl is caught in a rip current, leaving her unconscious on the beach. And in Great Yarmouth, an inquisitive cat sparks a media frenzy.
