Quest
Today, April 11
Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First through the barn doors is a stoneware elephant purchased by a young British couple, Michel and Paul, when they lived in New Zealand. The couple immediately fell in love with the long-legged elephant, affectionately naming it Derrick. Tragically, Paul passed away unexpectedly from pneumonia, triggering Michel to return to the UK to be near family and friends.
