Today, March 21
Resident ceramic expert Kirsten Ramsay takes on a beautiful Majolica Vase, which has met with several accidents over the years: a lid broken into several pieces, damage from a falling painting, and a decorative cherub who has been decapitated. Meanwhile metal worker Dominic Chinea works on a secret project, the restoration of a pub sign for the last landlord of much loved local that has been knocked down to make way for a bus station.
