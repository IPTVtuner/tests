Quest
Today, May 20
In Witley, Sarah Moore turns three skipbound items into money-makers. Carpenters Josh and Oli are called upon to repurpose some wooden bed ends, while designer Lucy Tiffney gets to grips with a broken-up sideboard. Two rattan chairs in need of restoration are Sarah's own project, but will all her rescuing and revamping rustle up a profit to return to the items' original owners?
