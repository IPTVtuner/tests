Keith Kear from Epping Forest has a junior drum kit for musical instrument expert Pete Woods to work on. The 1920s drums were originally his father's, and then a young Keith played them to his heart's content. Keith's sons were the next to enjoy them, but all that banging by enthusiastic young drummers has left them worse for wear.
