Furniture restorer William Kirk takes on a cherished family rocking horse that is in desperate need of some TLC. The paint work and plaster is flaking away and the leather work is tattered and torn, but saddler maker Suzie Fletcher is on hand. Together they do a beautiful job and return the rocking horse to the delight of the family.
