Quest
Today, November 17
Series in which Henry Cole and Sam Lovegrove nose around people's sheds and garages in search of automotive bargains. Today, the pair visit two amazing sets of sheds in the Oxfordshire and Hampshire area. In the heart of Oxfordshire they find rare Minis, 1970s Rollers, and a pristine rally car. The Hampshire sheds are full to the rafters with Japanese bikes, but they come away with a real surprise. Selling their projects on, however, proves to be a real challenge.
