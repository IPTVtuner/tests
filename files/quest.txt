Quest
Today, March 10
Silversmith Brenton West is tasked with reviving a worn-down singing trophy that celebrates the musical talent of a sadly departed mother. Won in 1955, it commemorates a young girl who turned her back on singing when she started a family. With one handle missing and the silver plate tarnished and dented, the trophy is in bad shape.
