Gordon travels to Oakhurst, New Jersey, to help Mike Farber, the overwhelmed owner of Mike and Nellie's restaurant, who lost his way when Nellie, his father and business partner, died. Opened in 1996, the restaurant was a lifelong dream for the father and son. Alone at the helm, and still mourning the loss of his father, Mike has taken his eye off the ball and the restaurant has gone to pot.
