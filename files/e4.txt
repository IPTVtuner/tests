Ted's friends are worried that Ted isn't confronting his feelings about Stella. They go out for dinner and upon finding Stella in the same restaurant, Ted ducks under a table and encourages his friends to do the same to avoid speaking to her. Later, Ted goes after Stella to talk about the break up but gets angry when he hears that she's moving to New York for Tony.
