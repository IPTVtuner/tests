Today, December 11
Lily and Ted fall out after Lily hears an old message on Marshall's machine encouraging Marshall to recall Lily's bad points, to help get over her, and ending in Ted calling Lily a grinch. Ted protests that he was trying to help his friend get over the break up as quickly as possible but Lily takes offence. Will the two ruin the gang's Christmas celebrations with their bickering?
