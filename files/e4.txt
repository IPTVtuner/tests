Someone tries to murder Homer in the steam room at the Stagnant Springs Spa. Needing help from someone who understands the mind of a killer, Chief Wiggum invites Sideshow Bob out of prison to help investigate the case, but has Bob got over his compulsion to kill Bart, and can he work out who Homer could possibly have annoyed enough to provide a motive for murder?
