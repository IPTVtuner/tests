Today, November 30
Two twin brothers, Jared and Simon, and their sister Mallory are relocated by their mother to their great-great uncle's creepy home in the middle of nowhere. Exploring, Jared finds his great-great uncle's secret study and a book, the `Field Guide to the Fantastical World around Them', which opens up a world of goblins, spirits, ogres, trolls and griffins, some of whom are friendly and helpful and others not.
