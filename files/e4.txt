The guys notice that Sheldon disappears for 20 minutes right after lunch every day. Filled with curiosity, they attempt to follow him and work out what on earth he's been doing. Meanwhile, Penny befriends a British student in her class and they start exchanging text messages, which makes Leonard jealous, so he tries to discourage their friendship.
