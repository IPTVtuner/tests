In each edition Susan visits one of Britain's best-loved holiday destinations and samples all the resort has to offer. It's a jam-packed summer for Susan as she throws herself into beach life in Bournemouth, takes to the water in all kinds of boats in sunny Southwold, gets her skates on in Margate, soars to new heights on the Ferris Wheel in Clacton-on-Sea and drops in on the world's biggest chippie in Cleethorpes. At each destination, Susan is joined by a celebrity friend who shares what they love about the seaside.
