On the evening of 20th January 1993, actress and style icon Audrey Hepburn died of a very rare form of abdominal cancer, at the age of 63. With an Academy Award and ten Golden Globe nominations, Audrey was admired not only for her starring roles in `My Fair Lady', `Breakfast at Tiffany's and `War and Peace' but also for her style, grace and elegance. Following the birth of her two sons she retired from acting, becoming a humanitarian ambassador who travelled the world with Unicef.
