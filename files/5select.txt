Ben travels north to Alaska to live with Bretwood Higman, Erin McCittrick and their two children. Bretwood and Erin hiked 4,000 miles to get here, and the family now lives for half the year in a Mongolian-style yurt on the mountainside, with the other half spent hiking in the wilderness. While staying with them, Ben learns how to chop trees and protect himself from grizzly bears.
