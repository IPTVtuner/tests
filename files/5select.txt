Starting in the cab of Puffing Billy, the world's oldest surviving steam locomotive, Chris Tarrant looks at the lives of two leading railway pioneers and the navvies who dug the tunnels and laid the tracks. He also reveals how rail changed the food we eat, and learns how a disaster in Armagh led the government to impose national safety standards.
