ITV2 +1
Today, January 27
The theme is Modern Life. The sketches poke fun at situations such as sending a naughty picture to the wrong person, being addicted to posting motivational quotes, and the moment your cringeworthy first email address comes back to haunt you. Meanwhile, stand-up covers topics including the horror of your phone dying, stalking crushes online, and the onslaught of annoying fitness trends. Plus, impressions of Holly Willoughby, Gemma Collins and Stacey Dooley.
