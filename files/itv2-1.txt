Mr Bean loves playing in the neighbourhood soft play centre - bouncing on the trampolines, whizzing down the slides and immersing himself in the ball pool. He does not like sharing the place with all those annoying kids. So Bean decides to turn his flat into his own private play area where he can play in peace. Unfortunately Irma, Mrs Wicket and The Bruisers all want to join in the fun with him.
