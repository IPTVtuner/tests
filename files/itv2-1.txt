Joining host Scarlett Moffatt is singleton James, who's choosing one of three women to date based solely on their cooking skills. Single cooks Mads, Amy and Jess will each prep a three-course menu and James will sample all their food, but won't know who has cooked which dish. Tasting completed, he will pick his favourite dish - and the cook behind it will join him for a date. So will Mads, Amy or Jess cook their way into James's heart?
