Twenty-year-old estate agent Ocea from Kent is hoping to find love - she's going to put her faith in the fashion choices of three single guy shoppers. The lads must choose outfits that fit Ocea's brief - 'a day at Ascot races' and a 'night out dress' - across two rounds, but she will be completely in the dark about who the guys are.
