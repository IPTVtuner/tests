Halloween is Shrek's favourite holiday, and this year he's planning a night of frights - all done ogre-style. Instead of the usual tricks or treats, Shrek challenges Fiona, Donkey, Puss in Boots and the other fairy tale characters to spend the night in Lord Farquaad's haunted castle telling scary stories. The last one to be scared `Shrekless' will win.
