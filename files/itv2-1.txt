Stewie's favourite thing after his teddy bear Rupert, is Christmas. When he hears that Santa is making an appearance at the mall, he begs Brian to take him so that he can tell Santa in person what he wants for Christmas. Brian begrudgingly takes Stewie to the mall, only to get the brush off from Santa and as a result, Stewie and Brian travel to the North Pole to find Santa and teach him a lesson.
