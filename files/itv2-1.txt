Peter starts an anti-immigration group, but he quickly changes his mind when he finds out that he was born in Mexico. Unable to prove his citizenship, pass the naturalisation test or convince investigators that his marriage to Lois is for real, he ends up working for Carter as a landscaper, all the while fighting for immigration rights.
