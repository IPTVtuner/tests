Alan Carr gives an epic twist to another iconic gameshow, and this time it's Take Your Pick. A host of plucky audience members go up against the gong and play the famous Yes/No game as Alan Carr bombards them with hilarious questions. One lucky player will make it through to the brand-new epic endgame and could take home a car. The show also features The Chase's Dark Destroyer, Shaun Wallace.
