When Peter reads some of Stephen King's works, he imagines his family and friends in three of King's stories. Firstly, Peter, Quagmire, Cleveland and Joe act out `Stand By Me', where as 12-year-olds they travel along a railroad track on a journey of self-discovery. Secondly, Peter's take on `Misery' puts an injured Brian being rescued by his fan, Stewie. Finally, Peter envisions his own version of the `Shawshank Redemption'.
