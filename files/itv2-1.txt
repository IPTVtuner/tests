Documentary series where reality star Olivia Attwood explores the new and unchartered world of selling sex. The classic porn star body is no longer needed to make big money in the modern-day sex industry - in this episode of the programme, Olivia meets people that have monetised their XL body types in a sex industry that believes that bigger is better. Her investigation includes a trip to Las Vegas to meet Marilyn, a size 24 woman who has made a fortune from a fetish for big and beautiful women.
