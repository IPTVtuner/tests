Scarlett Moffatt, Chris Hughes, Bobby Norris, The Vivienne and a new recruit take on the terrifying Superhuman Bosses - including a bone-crunching bout with one of the world's strongest men and a breathless encounter with The Mermaid - in a series of battles in the Torture Dome, before the weakest of them is strapped inside a human pi√±ata and beaten for cash.
