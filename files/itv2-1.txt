Mr Bean is over the moon when he meets Mr Pod - the two men have so much in common: the same shirt, jacket, trousers and even underpants, and to top it all, Pod is Bean's spitting image, but Mr Bean falls to earth with a bump when his girlfriend, Irma Gobb, finds Mr Pod much better looking than him.
