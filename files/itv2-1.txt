Scarlett Moffatt hosts as singleton Rashaun chooses to date one of Harley, Naomi and Keelie - not on their looks but their cooking skills. The trio will each prep a three-course meal which Rashaun will taste blind, so he has no clue whose dish is whose. After picking his favourite menu, the cook behind it will reveal themselves and join him for a date. Will it be Harley, Naomi or Keelie - and will it be love at first bite for Rashaun?
