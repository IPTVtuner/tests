On Doctor's orders to visit a therapist to deal with his anxiety, Dawson heads to Boston, but quickly decides against the therapy thing, and opts instead for a mind-numbing evening at the frat house with Jack. The fun gets a bit out of hand when Dawson and the other drunken students stop by Pacey's dock party, where a curious Joey wonders what's happened to Dawson until he makes a startling admission.
