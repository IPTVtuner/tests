This time, Alan is supersizing the 90s classic Strike It Lucky. In this fantastically fun show, three pairs of players will be choosing the top, middle or bottom as they navigate their way across a sea of screens, trying not to let their greed stop them banking too many prizes, and avoiding the infamous hotspots. One lucky pair will reach the epic endgame, where they stand to win a mountain of prizes and a luxury holiday to Las Vegas.
