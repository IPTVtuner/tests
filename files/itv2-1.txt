Harry is dismayed when the Ministry of Magic denies Voldemort's return and appoints a nasty new teacher at Hogwarts to keep an eye on Dumbledore. The new teacher's constant meddling with the curriculum convinces the students that school cannot prepare them for the battle ahead, so they form a secret duelling club with Harry as their tutor.
