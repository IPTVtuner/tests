There's a new addition to the Epic Gameshow family this time: classic music gameshow Name That Tune. Host Alan Carr is joined by a live house band who play a whole host of party anthems, while four hopeful contestants try to name that tune in the shortest time possible. There's a 25,000 pound jackpot at stake, so they've got to be quick. Singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor makes a guest appearance at the piano for the iconic Bid-A-Note round.
