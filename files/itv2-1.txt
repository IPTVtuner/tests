When the local dry cleaner loses Peter's favourite white shirt, he goes ballistic. Meanwhile, Brian tries to score on a date with a new friend, Denise, but ends up striking out. Instead of calling it quits on love, he enlists Quagmire's help, but things get nasty when they start to compete for the affections of each other's old flames, Cheryl Tiegs and Jillian.
