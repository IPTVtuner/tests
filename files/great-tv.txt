Steed and his team are present at the test of a new sleeping gas called S-95, so they are immunised to its effects. On Sunday morning, they wake up to find the whole city of London fast asleep. The city's banks and jewellery shops are unprotected and the Avengers are the only people awake, apart from the unknown enemy.
