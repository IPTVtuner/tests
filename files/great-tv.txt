Jeff Randall and Marty Hopkirk are private investigators. They are not only partners, but close friends - that is, until the day Marty Hopkirk is run down by a car and killed. Everyone assumes it is an accident - until the startled Jeff Randall is faced by Hopkirk, suddenly materialising to tell his former partner that the killing was murder, the outcome of a divorce case the firm was working on for Mrs Fay Sorrensen.
