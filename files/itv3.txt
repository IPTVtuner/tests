Doc encourages Bert Large to give up plumbing and to open a restaurant, but Bert's opening night is far from successful when Martin treats a host of patients with suspected food poisoning the following day. Bert hires a new chef, and passes a health inspection, but customer numbers continue to dwindle until the real cause for the sickness is discovered.
