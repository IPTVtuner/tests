A particularly dangerous rapist is at large on Frost's patch and Superintendent Mullett, worried about public and press perceptions as usual, puts WPC Wallace on the case to add a `woman's insight' into the investigations. In his effort to trap the rapist, Frost exposes the junior officer to danger. He has been out on a limb before, but never this far.
