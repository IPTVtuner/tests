Hugh Woozencroft presents coverage of Tonga against Romania at the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France as the two sides play their final game of the pool stages at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Lille - this is the first meeting between the two sides at the tournament, but they did play each other in 2021 when Romania came out on top with a 32-20 win in Bucharest. Studio analysis comes from Rory Best, Nolli Waterman and Gareth Thomas, and commentary is provided by Nick Mullins and Ben Kay.
