When a teenage girl is found dead, the police cannot be sure a crime was committed, but the girl's mother is convinced that her daughter was raped, and further investigation uncovers a murder weapon and a possible suspect. Senior crown prosecutor James Steel remembers this particular suspect well - and he is positive the man is guilty. Steel pursues him with every power available to him, pushing the law to its limit.
