Morse is concerned about a murder case believed closed after the death of the accused, as a fifth victim's body is still to be accounted for. Morse is convinced that the body, that of a single woman on a day trip to Oxford, is in Wytham Woods. However, her bag was found at Blenheim Lake and when a body is discovered there, Morse and Lewis are assigned to the case.
