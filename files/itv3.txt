Novelist Ariadne Oliver attends a Hallowe'en party in Woodleigh Common and hears young Joyce Reynolds boast of having witnessed a murder years before. When the girl is discovered drowned in an apple-bobbing bucket later that evening, Ariadne calls on her old friend Hercule Poirot to investigate. The Belgian sleuth soon uncovers a series of mysterious deaths in the village - any of which Joyce could have seen.
