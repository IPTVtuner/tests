Aidensfield becomes the scene of a murder hunt when a retired top London policeman is shot dead. Elsewhere, village constable Nick Rowan finds himself working with the boys from the Met once again, but all his reasons for leaving London are confirmed when the heavy-footed Scotland Yard policemen put a few local noses out of joint.
