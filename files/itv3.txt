The first episode in the second series of the 21st-century adaptation of HE Bates' classic novel The Darling Buds of May. Pop accepts a lucrative offer that he can't refuse, and the Jerebohms - who have become new neighbours of the Larkins - host a hilariously dire dinner party, but will they become friends or foes? Meanwhile, adventures and romance blossom for Primrose.
