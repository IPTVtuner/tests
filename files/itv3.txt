When a maintenance engineer is found dead in the basement of the Bodleian library, Lewis and Hathaway investigate a link between the murder and an intruder at a local professor's home earlier in the night. Suspicion grows when they visit the engineer's house and discover rare nineteenth-century books, which were taken from the library in which he worked.
