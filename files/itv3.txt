Series about an eminent surgeon who develops a phobia of blood and has to retrain as a GP. When a vacancy arises in the sleepy Cornish hamlet of Portwenn, Dr Martin Ellingham jumps at the chance, but later realises that adjusting to village life is not going to be plain sailing. In his sharp suits and flashy car, Martin is like a fish out of water, and his brusque manner does not go down too well with some of the locals.
