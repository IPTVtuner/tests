The remains of an eight-year-old boy are uncovered, twenty-five years after he was reported missing. DS Brooks and Devlin re-interview the man arrested during the original enquiry. The boy's childhood friend reluctantly agrees to undergo EMDR therapy and appears to recall the events of the night that Tommy disappeared, but George Castle is sceptical about the value of her recovered memories.
