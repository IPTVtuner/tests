Portwenn is buzzing with the news of Martin and Louisa's engagement - but Aunt Joan is disappointed that she has to hear about the impending nuptials from the village postman rather than her own nephew. Elsewhere, Beth Sawle's wound isn't healing and Martin discovers that her sister has been treating her with a homemade potion - which proves to be the cause of an outbreak of aspergillosis in the village.
