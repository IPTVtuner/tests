Rishi Persad presents coverage of the 2023 British Open from the Centaur in Cheltenham, the only tournament on the World Snooker Tour to feature an open draw - this session features the first eight frames of the final. Ryan Day described 2022's win as 'the biggest of his career' after defeating Mark Allen 10-7 in the final, but no player has ever retained the title, and there will be a host of top names vying to win the 100,000-pound first prize.
