It's the grouse season and Rose's father-in-law Lord Sinderby has rented Brancaster Castle in Northumberland and invited the Crawleys to a shooting party. While good sport is enjoyed, a butler with an axe to grind and a scandalous secret threaten to undermine the holiday. Surprises are in store as the families become better acquainted with each other and some new faces arrive on the scene.
