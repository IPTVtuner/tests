Morse finds romance in an unlikely setting as he investigates the suspicious death of a female deacon. St Saviour's College is about to appoint Oxford's first ever female chaplain, and emotions are running high among the university's more conservative clerics, but Morse and Lewis find it hard to fathom how such feelings could lead to murder.
