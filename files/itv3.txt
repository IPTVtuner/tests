A snow blizzard sets in and Miss Marple is forced to take refuge at Sittaford House, isolated on a bleak Devon moor. The owner of the house, Captain Trevelyan, inexplicably decides to spend the night at a local hotel where a ouija board predicts his death. He is later found dead in his room - and Miss Marple's suspicions are confirmed.
