When a farmer is found horribly murdered in the middle of a stone circle, suspicion points at a group of druids. DCI John Barnaby and DS Jones hurry to the scene of the crime, where they are joined by new pathologist Kate Wilding on her first assignment. Druid high priest Leticia Clifford shows Barnaby that sacred ley lines run through the stone circle and later is convinced she has made an exciting discovery.
