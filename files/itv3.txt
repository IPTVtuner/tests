Matthew Crawley and his mother Isobel arrive at Downton, and Isobel and the Dowager Countess Violet find their views clashing from the outset. Matthew has difficulty settling in to this new life, and the staff do little to ease his discomfort. Meanwhile Carson is mortified when confronted by his past, but finds an ally in an unexpected quarter. Elsewhere, Violet attempts to promote a match between Matthew and Mary.
