Danny Trevanion is a vet confronted with an unusual patient - a half-dead African monkey called Valentine. When his stepson Evan develops an attachment to the animal, Danny's wife suggests that they take Valentine back to Africa and release him into the wild. On arrival in the continent, their first meeting with a cantankerous South African landowner is less than propitious.
