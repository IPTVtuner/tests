Lewis and Hathaway investigate the strange murder of a beautiful young Eastern European woman whose death comes straight from the pages of a popular fantasy novel written by Oxford tutor Dorian Crane. Is this the work of a crazed fan, or is there something even more sinister going on? Soon it becomes evident that those close to Crane are in danger.
