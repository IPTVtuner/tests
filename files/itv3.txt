DS Ronnie Brooks and DS Matt Devlin are forced to reopen a contentious murder case, and their investigations threaten to unravel James Steel's prosecution of Luke Slade eight years before. Slade, who has been studying law during his time in prison, is given leave to appeal. When he opts to represent himself in court, the case becomes less of a legal appeal and more of a personal vendetta between Slade and Steel.
