Crime drama series. The body of undergraduate Josh Tate is found dumped in a ravine, stabbed with a screwdriver. His flatmate Spencer Foster says that Josh was the quiet type - he last saw him heading off to his part-time job at the university lab. But as the team piece together his movements, a picture emerges of another Josh, who was infatuated with Spencer's lap-dancer girlfriend Melanie and was manufacturing ecstasy for club owner Liam Fallon.
