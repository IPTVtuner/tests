When an old friend of Hathaway's commits suicide, Lewis investigates a link between him and a religious group known as The Garden, who he suspects are brainwashing their congregation. However, a serial killer also knows about the organisation and has started to pick off its members one by one, leaving Lewis with only so much time to solve the case before another victim is murdered.
