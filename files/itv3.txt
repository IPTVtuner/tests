A battle of the sexes which has raged in Broughton since the First World War comes to a head when ageing feminist Mildred Danvers is found dead after returning to her childhood home. As Barnaby investigates, the misogynist vicar Rev Gantis is shot through the head during a humiliating donkey race at the village fair. Is the killer on the side of the men or women - or do tragedies in Broughton's past hold the answer?
