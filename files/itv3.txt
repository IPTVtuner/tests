Joanna kicks off her adventure in Havana in a boxing gym with one of Cuba's rising female boxing stars. She visits the stars of the cabaret at the National Hotel that pre-dates the revolution and entertains the cigar workers while they roll cigars in their factory. She visits the small town of Hershey, built on the success of the sugar industry, and visits the tomb of Che Guevara before heading off to Hemingway's favourite beach that is being turned into a five-star luxury complex.
