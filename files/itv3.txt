Banks and his team are called on to investigate the murder of teenager Ellie Clayton, daughter of an internet entrepreneur. The high profile of the victim's family, coupled with the suggestion that she had also been raped, means that there is intense media speculation about the case. There is strong evidence implicating Owen Pierce, a local theatre director who ran the workshop that Ellie attended on the night she died.
