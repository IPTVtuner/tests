The second spin-off from the popular comedy series finds Stan wanting to get married. The rest of his family frown at the suggestion as they depend on his earnings, so he decides to teach his brother-in-law how to follow in his footsteps and drive a bus. The resultant comic set-piece is a treacherous spin through Windsor Safari Park.
