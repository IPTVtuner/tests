Rosie decides that she's had enough and is going back to Bristol. Thanks to Evan, Danny botches an attempt to shoot a lioness with a tranquilliser dart. When he and Du Plessis try to track her, their truck hits a termite mound and overturns - trapping Anders underneath. A resentful Evan runs away, taking Olivia with him. They head off into the bush, unaware that they are being stalked by the lioness.
