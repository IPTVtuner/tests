A massage mix-up leaves Rosie thinking Sarah and Tate are romantically involved. Meanwhile, the first paying guests to appear at Leonard's Den, the Chapman family, are not impressed on their arrival and things get steadily worse when the generator breaks down. The devious Tate has engineered the situation deliberately and made sure their diesel delivery didn't arrive.
