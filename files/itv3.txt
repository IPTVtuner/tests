PC Nick Rowan investigates the strange case of the house-proud housebreaker, and Aidensfield has seen a spat of burglaries recently and in each one only silverware has been stolen. However, a common and baffling clue in every case is the fact that the thief tidies the house. Rowan also becomes suspicious of the do-gooder, considered by many to be a `saint'.
