Jeff Randall is confined to his bed. He has met with an accident - a fall from a balcony - and he's therefore a captive audience when Marty Hopkirk insists on telling of a case he handled entirely on his own, without mentioning it to Jeff, before he met his death and became a ghost. Jeff is forced to listen in disbelief to a remarkable spy drama which began with a telephone call asking for him.
