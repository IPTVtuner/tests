Martin makes a good impression when he meets one of the interviewers for the surgeon's job in London, but he realises that he is not really over his blood phobia, so he books a session with a renowned cognitive therapist recommended by Edith. Meanwhile, the parents of a boy who fell ill following a visit to Aunt Joan's farm hold her responsible for his condition and threaten to sue her.
