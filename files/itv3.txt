Barnaby begins to question the guilt of a Midsomer Malham woman who is on trial for the murder of her best friend. The evidence is stacked against her, but she doesn't appear deluded or obsessed with the dead woman's husband as the prosecution claim. With the help of a frail pensioner - the key witness, can Barnaby and Jones discover what really happened on the night of the murder?
