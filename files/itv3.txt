The residents of Weatherfield love a change of scenery, but holidays very rarely go to plan. We revisit the first episode filmed entirely on location in 1967, and a coach trip to Windermere in 1969 that ended in disaster. Plus, we remember Bet, Rita and Mavis's romantic flings on a girl's holiday to Majorca in 1974.
