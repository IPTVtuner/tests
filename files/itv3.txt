When Nick Cheyney, director of a new film of `The Scarlet Pimpernel' is beheaded by a guillotine on set, there is no shortage of suspects. An actor whose career he has ruined, a woman who bore his child after a drunken one-night stand, and an embittered gay, alcoholic extra all have grudges against him. Medical evidence then shows that Cheyney was drugged with morphine. Can Barnaby and Jones find the killer?
