April 1944. Hastings Police station has changed since Foyle resigned: DCS Meredith has taken over, Sam has been fired and Milner wants a transfer, but when the case of a young man found hanging in a wood is written off as a suicide by Meredith, Milner investigates it and finds an aerial photograph of a German village in the man's pocket. He believes it's murder and realises that Foyle is the only person who would agree.
