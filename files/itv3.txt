When an old colleague of DCI Barnaby's is found murdered, a sex scandal at Causton police station 16 years previously comes back to haunt him. His investigation takes him to Midsomer Holm, a halfway house for ex-prisoners founded by Lord Holm, a man who also served time for the murder of his wife. As they try to find links between the suspects and a seedy group known as the Friday Nighters, another person goes missing.
