It's 1956 and Sidney Chambers, vicar of Grantchester, is yearning for some excitement. However, his best friend, DI Geordie Keating, is starting to worry that this daredevil attitude is verging on a death wish. Seeking inspiration, Sidney and his curate, Leonard Finch, attend a talk by Reverend Nathaniel Todd, who is part of the formative Civil Rights movement in America.
