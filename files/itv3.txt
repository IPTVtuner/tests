There are problems for the police when PC Bellamy has to organise a talent contest, while Nick and Kate's relationship is put to the test when one of her old flames, Peter, arrives in town. To make matters worse, Nick is called out to investigate a hit-and-run accident, and his inquiries point to Peter as a prime suspect.
