A case hits close to home for DS Matt Devlin when he investigates the death of a policeman, his best friend Sergeant Pete Garvey - whom he had known since they were boys. When Matt discovers that Pete had been in contact with their childhood priest Jonathan Nugent, he is suspicious because Pete claimed to have been sexually abused by Nugent. However, with nothing but rumours to go on, a murder charge cannot be issued.
