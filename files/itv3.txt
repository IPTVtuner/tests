When a notorious crime family shoots dead a shop manager during a jewellery raid, an accomplice turns informer, only to be gunned down himself. As a witness to the slaying, DS Satchell finds his life and that of his young daughter in danger, and nowhere appears to offer sanctuary from the malign influence of the crime family - not even the police station itself.
