A man called Gary Tully is found dead in a hotel room and the money he was carrying has gone missing. Ronnie and Sam discover that Gary owed his ex-wife thousands of pounds in child support for their son, who has leukaemia. The boy's grandfather is the only suspect and when he admits that he did shoot the deadbeat dad in self-defence, the case appears to be closed.
