When business magnate Rex Fortescue, his young wife and their maid are found murdered, Miss Marple notices that the circumstances recall the nursery rhyme `Sing a Song of Sixpence'. It is not long before she discovers that secrets and scandal run deep in the Fortescue family, but the significance of the song itself is harder to unravel.
