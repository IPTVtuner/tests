Laura and Rosemary join Laura's son Matthew and his friends on their annual tennis holiday at a camp in southern Spain. When one of the players is found dead after a night out, everyone assumes it was a drunken accident - but the girls suspect foul play. As they immerse themselves in Spanish culture, they soon come to realise that the value of property seems to be the driving force for evil in the idyllic resort.
