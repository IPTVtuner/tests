A mother returns home from work to find her baby girl dead in her cot, and her nanny has disappeared. DCI Connor and the team take on this emotive case involving this ultimate abuse of trust. With the nanny on the run, it seems an obvious conclusion. However, the more they investigate the case, the more complicated it becomes and they find themselves wondering who is the real victim and who they can really trust.
