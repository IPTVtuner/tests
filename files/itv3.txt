When a former footballer is beaten to death on a London street in what looks like a robbery gone wrong, investigations lead Ronnie and Matt to Mike Jones. He was seen in the area at the time of the murder, has motive and is linked to the murder weapon. Protesting his innocence, Mike points the finger at a well-known East End gangster who he claims he saw at the scene of the crime.
