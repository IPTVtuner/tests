A visit from Organised Crime confirms Colette's suspicions that there's more to Stacey's death than suicide. Tracing the few clues she has, Colette pieces together fragments that point to one person's involvement. After successfully closing a case, Colette joins her team at the pub for a drink. At home, however, Colette rocks the boat with Cara and has to tread carefully to make amends.
