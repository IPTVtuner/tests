Midsomer Barton is celebrating Oak Apple Week when a mother is found drowned. It looks like suicide, and that she was driven to it by grief over her dead daughter. Barnaby investigates and is shaken by two villagers who look like murder victims from his past. Then another body is discovered and it appears that the festivities have stirred up a cocktail of adultery, contempt, unrequited love and revenge in the village.
