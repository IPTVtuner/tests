The team try to find the killer of Peter Williams, a private investigator found dead in a car park. Williams worked for a very shady PI company and everyone involved in the firm seem to have something to hide, but it is DS Shap's unhealthy interest in the case that draws most attention. He seems to be on a personal crusade - but why is he so keen to crack the case solo?
