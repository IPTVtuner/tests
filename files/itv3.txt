The police launch a search when Nick, George and Greengrass are locked in the cellar of the Aidensfield Arms overnight by robbers, who make off with the contents of the till. It's not until morning that the trio are discovered by a man delivering beer to the pub. Elsewhere, Greengrass told Nick that Dave Chapman is trading in stolen farm machinery.
