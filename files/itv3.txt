DCI Janine Lewis returns to investigate crime. Janine and Richard have a close shave when a suspect and a police colleague are killed just metres away from them. They try to come to terms with their shock as they examine the case: a jewellery robbery gone wrong, a hit-and-run accident resulting in death, and now a double murder.
