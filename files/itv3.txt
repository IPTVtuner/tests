When call girl Katka Cizek is found dead in a pool of blood in an upmarket apartment, the evidence seems to point to one of her admirers. The man was with her on the night of her death, does not have an alibi and has everything to lose if his secret obsession with her were to be revealed. When the case comes to court, crown prosecutor Alesha Phillips is given the reins to lead the cross-examination.
