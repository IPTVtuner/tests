Joanna completes her Cuban journey by visiting the infamous town of Guantanamo. Giving the prison a wide berth, she discovers that the song `Guantanamera' was born in the town, and she meets a talented young singer who is recording the track herself. Fifty-seven miles across the Windward Passage to Haiti, she discovers a very different country, currently the poorest in the western world. She visits the Citadel, a mighty fortress built to deter the colonial powers of France, Spain and England.
