In the sleepy English village of St Mary Mead, one man - Colonel Protheroe - is intensely disliked by everyone. Even the vicar has good reason to want to murder him. Then Protheroe is found with a bullet through the head, slumped over the desk in the vicarage study. The obvious suspects seem to be the colonel's wife or her lover - but have they been set up? Miss Marple unpicks the truth behind the crime.
