Today, October 31
On one long gruelling day, the team work flat-out on three separate cases. The day starts early for Ronnie and Sam as they are called to a murder scene in the early hours. Later, they take a 999 call when a sibling dispute turns murderous. Then, a frantic morning takes another turn when an allegation of police intimidation is made against one of the team. The day is no less busy in court for prosecutors Jake and Alesha.
