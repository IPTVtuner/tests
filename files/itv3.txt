Sergeant Dan Scott arrives to work with Barnaby and is thrown straight into a murder investigation in Midsomer Mallow. A noise heard near the scene of Fiona Thompson's bloodstained body leads police to suspect an odd-job man, but when the murder toll rises, Barnaby becomes concerned for Cully, who is organising a ten-year school reunion.
