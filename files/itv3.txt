In an effort to get Maggie to stay in Portwenn after she gets the all-clear, PC Joe Penhale tries to prove that he is the man for her - and even engineers situations where he can show off his macho side to impress her. But will his attempts at subterfuge work? Martin steps in when school caretaker Mr Coley becomes muddled and puts the children of the school at risk. Also, tensions mount between Martin and Louisa.
