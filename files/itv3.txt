When Madame Giselle is murdered by a poisoned dart on a flight from Paris to London, fellow passenger Hercule Poirot finds himself caught up in the investigation and learns that the victim was known as a money-lender. On his return to Paris, Poirot discovers his chief suspect is a mysterious American - an enigma in itself as there was no American on the flight.
