Hired to provide the centrepiece amusement of a Devonshire summer fÃªte, a twisty-turny `murder hunt', novelist Ariadne Oliver becomes convinced that she is being manipulated, that her plans are providing the cover for a very grave crime indeed. Unable to navigate the web of deceit and treachery spun by the locals, she calls to her side the only man in the world who can discern the truth of the matter: Hercule Poirot.
