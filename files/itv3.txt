It's 1935, and a team of international archaeologists in Egypt have broken the seal of the tomb of King Men-Her-Ra for the first time in 3000 years. Moments later, the leader of the group, Sir John Willard, drops down dead of a heart attack. Poirot is called upon to consider whether he is the victim of the tomb's legendary curse or whether there is a more mortal explanation for his death.
