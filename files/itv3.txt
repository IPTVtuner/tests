Bert Large's restaurant is in financial trouble - and he is being chased by loan sharks Alastair Tonken and his son. When Ruth gives Al Â£800 he uses the money to pay back the some of the loan, but Alastair Tonken tells them they still owe him. Al thinks it is time they stood up for themselves but PC Penhale says he can't help them - it's a civil matter. The Tonkens then put pressure on Mrs Dingley for the money they lent her.
