When what first looks like a case of cot death proves instead to be shaken baby syndrome, Ronnie and Matt embark on a murder investigation. They find several possible culprits, including the child's neglectful mother, the absent father, a resentful nanny and the nanny's short-tempered boyfriend. However, when the trial begins, new evidence comes to light which casts doubt on the prosecution's case.
