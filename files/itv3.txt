Barnaby and Jones are called away from a hated team-building exercise to investigate an explosion at a haulage yard run by Territorial Army officer Matt Parkes and his ruthless son James. James is involved in some shady activities, but is he capable of arson or murder? When a body turns up, there are plenty of other suspects on the scene, including a peace protestor and a host of trained killers at the TA.
