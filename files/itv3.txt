Human remains are found in a lake along with a hip flask engraved with the name Paul Cochran. Once a successful architect, and now staying in a rehab institution, Cochran is extremely agitated and makes little sense. Is he faking madness or does he have reason to be frightened? To unlock the case Janine must understand the pecking order of male friendships and rivalries.
