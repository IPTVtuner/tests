Danny is concerned that poachers may be in the area and when he finds one of his zebras has been killed, he and Du Plessis stake out the grazing area. They find more dead animals, but these were not killed by poachers. Tests reveal anthrax is the cause and Danny imposes a quarantine on Leopard's Den. Elsewhere, Sarah is upset by her friend Izzy and goes looking for a missing lion cub, but she collapses.
