Barnaby joins a trip from Midsomer Parva to Brighton because he's suspicious about a deal to buy coastal land for holiday chalets by Causton's mayor. Also against the proposal is Lady Matilda William, a descendant of a French knight Sir Richard Guillaume, whose son Richard will be the last of the line because of brain damage sustained in an attack 20 years ago.
