When a young woman slips away from a camp site where a Jane Austen fantasy event is taking place dressed in period attire, and is found stabbed in the woods with a quill, DCI Barnaby and DS Winter discover that the victim was a journalist interested in the village's healthcare drone delivery programme, and are forced to look back in time to find the killer.
