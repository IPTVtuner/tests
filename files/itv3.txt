DCI Cassie Stuart begins to identify people mentioned in the diary of Jimmy Sullivan, whose body has been found during a house demolition 39 years after his disappearance. Names mentioned in his diary include a senior public figure, who denies having known Jimmy, and a number of other people from very different walks of life. Cassie travels to Liverpool to interview Jimmy's mother, whose life has been on hold for nearly four decades and who is desperate to learn the truth about how her son died.
