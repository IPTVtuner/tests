Following the murder of a Counter Terrorism officer, Lana Washington and the EXPO team race against time to stop the bombers before they strike again. Sonya manages to trace the chemical explosive HMX used by the bombers to a government lab at Porton Down but runs up against a wall of silence when she pushes for further information. Lana demonstrates to Thom that the wiring within the devices shows evidence of advanced bomb making skills, leading her to suspect members of her own EXPO team.
