Round 13 of the 2023 World Rally Championship is the WRC FORUM8 Rally Japan - this year's final round features demanding asphalt roads in the mountain regions of Aichi and Gifu that were first seen at the 2022 event, and the stages are not only narrower and twistier than those in Europe, but also feature inconsistent grip on sections covered by trees. This is also the first time that the rally has been held in Nagoya on Honshu - which is Japan's main island - after previously being on Hokkaido.
