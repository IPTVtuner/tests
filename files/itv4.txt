Ali Hamidi and Bobby Zamora's bucket list fishing tour of Britain begins in Shropshire. Their first mission is to catch a specimen crucian of over 2lbs. Next, the boys head to a top syndicate water called The Avenue. The carp here go to over an incredible 60lbs. They set themselves the crazy mission of both beating their current UK carp PBs. Ali also calls in a favour from 2 Michelin-star chef and carp angler Daniel Clifford, to teach Zamo how to cook on the bank, to stop his moaning.
