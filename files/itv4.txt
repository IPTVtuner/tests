Motoring experts Vicki Butler-Henderson and Alex Riley go head-to-head championing what they think is the ultimate hot hatch to be realised in 1993. Vicki picks the Renault Clio Williams while Alex makes a case for the Lancia Delta Integrale EVO2. A winner is picked by a panel of judges made up of RM Sotheby's car specialist Will Smith, motoring author and vlogger Richard Porter, and Auto Trader editorial director Erin Baker.
