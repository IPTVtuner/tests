Jill Douglas presents exclusive coverage of the 2025 Players Championship from the Telford International Centre - a host of some of snooker's biggest names are in action as the top 16 on the one-year list go head-to-head for one of the sport's biggest prizes. Last year saw Mark Allen emerge victorious as he beat Zhang Anda in the final, and this session features further action from the semi-finals with matches played over the best of 11 frames.
