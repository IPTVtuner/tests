Tongue-in-cheek tale about a high-speed car chase across America involving a sheriff and a bootlegger with crash stunts galore. All goes well for the Bandit as he drives from Texas to Georgia with a truckload of illicit beer until he stops to pick up a damsel in distress, who also happens to be the sheriff's daughter.
