With the year 1969 selected, Vicki Butler-Henderson and Alex Riley argue the case for the best affordable GT car released in this classic year. Alex makes a case for the hugely popular Datsun 240Z, while Vicki drives 70's TV detectives favourite the Ford Capri. The winning car is selected by a judging panel made up of motoring experts featuring former racing driver and broadcaster Karun Chandhok, Hollywood stunt driver and author Ben Collins and top motoring presenter Rory Reid.
