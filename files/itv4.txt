The 2024 World Superbike Championship continues with the Acerbis Italian Round - the 3.768km track at the Cremona Circuit will push the riders to their very limits as they look to get points on the board. Located in Lombardy in northwest Italy and inaugurated in July 2011, the track was first extended in 2021 - based on a concept by the Italian circuit designer Jarno Zaffelli - before being resurfaced and extended again in 2023 in order to host World Superbike races.
