Two handymen are forced to postpone their plans to escape their humdrum lives after several mysterious deaths and a series of earthquakes turn out to be the work of predatory subterranean creatures which lay siege to the terrified townsfolk. An affectionate homage to the `creature features' of the 1950s.
