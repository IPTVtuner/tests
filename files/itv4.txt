Dean Macey and Adam Rooney are joined by England international angler Matt Godfrey as they head to the Cotswolds - a maze of lakes and waterways, and a great place for a triple fishing challenge. They kick off proceedings by targeting 5lb plus tench at an idyllic lake, before going urban on the Gloucester canal in the dead of night, in search of a 10lb zander, otherwise known as the Vampire Fish.
