On a remote island, a wealthy entrepreneur creates a theme park featuring living dinosaurs drawn from prehistoric DNA. Before opening the attraction to the public, he invites a top palaeontologist, palaeobotanist, mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park. Their park visit is anything but tranquil as the park's security system breaks down, and the prehistoric creatures break out.
