The 2025 World Superbike Championship continues with the Pirelli Portuguese Round - the 4.592km track at the Autodromo Internacional do Algarve will push the riders to their very limits as they look to get points on the board. The early years of WorldSBK saw the championship visit Portugal on two occasions with four races held at the Estoril track in the 1988 and 1993 seasons - the series then returned to the western European country in 2008 at the 100,000-capacity Algarve International Circuit.
