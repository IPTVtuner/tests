A new boat has joined the fleet: Peter MacKenzie is skipper of the Triton, and has already caught two and a half tonnes of lobster this season. He's heading back out for more. Money talks, and the all-in price of lobsters has spiked hard to more than $100 per kilo. The season's big winner is the William Norling, where skipper Danny has reached his season target and is now on the phone to his buyers, playing each one off against the other to try and secure the highest price.
