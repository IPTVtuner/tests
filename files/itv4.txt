Monster carp hunters Ali Hamidi, Neil Spooner and Tom Dove make the long journey to Thailand - a country where they've previously caught huge Siamese carp - but this time the focus is on the other species of carp which are found there. Their adventure is split between Fishing Park Samui and Gillhams Fishing Resorts, where they will have to use all of their skill and knowledge to outwit as many different carp species as possible.
