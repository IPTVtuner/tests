The Good is Blondie, a wandering gunman with a strong personal sense of honour; the Bad is Angel Eyes, a sadistic hit man who always hits his mark; and the Ugly is Tuco, a Mexican bandit who's always only looking out for himself. Against the backdrop of the Civil War, they search for a fortune in gold buried in a graveyard. Each knows only a portion of the gold's exact location, so they must work together.
