Atmospheric tale about a gun-toting preacher who defends a settlement from attack. In the late 1800s, a young girl witnesses a violent attack on a gold-mining settlement and prays for a miracle to save the camp and its people. Her prayers seem answered when a stranger arrives and helps the prospectors defend themselves, but his real motives are a mystery.
