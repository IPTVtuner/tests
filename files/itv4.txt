Another great white shark arrives to terrorise the holiday resort of Amity Island. Having recovered from the grisly events of four years ago, the island is once again packed with tourists. Families are sailing in the bay and swimming off the beach, but when two divers and a water-skier go missing, the local police chief fears that he is about to relive his greatest nightmare.
