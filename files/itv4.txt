The Bristol Bears and Bath Rugby take their West Country rivalry on the road as they meet in the Big Day Out at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff - Bath have been the form team of the 2024-25 Gallagher Premiership season and can look forward to a home draw in the semi-finals of the play-offs, while Bristol are still very much in contention for a top four finish but need a win to keep pace with the challenging pack.
