Action from the 19th round of the season as riders look to secure vital championship points at the Qatar Airways Grand Prix of Qatar, which is taking place at the Lusail International Circuit - this fabulous circuit lies on the outskirts of Doha, the capital city of Qatar, and was built in little over a year. The track required round-the-clock dedication from almost 1,000 workers in order to get it ready for its inaugural event, which was the Marlboro Grand Prix of Qatar in October 2004.
