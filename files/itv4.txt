British agent James Bond investigates the disappearance of an Anglo-American space shuttle, which has fallen into the hands of a billionaire megalomaniac intent on world domination. Along the way, Bond has to contend with giant, steel-toothed hit man Jaws, before stowing away on a flight to a space station being used as a colony to breed a genetically `pure' race.
