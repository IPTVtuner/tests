Clive, Skipper of the Minnamurra, needs to jump start his catch rate if he's any chance of turning a profit for the season. In the Bass Strait, Skipper Danny is using a depth sounder to locate the shallow reef bottoms because that's where the giant red lobsters are feeding - it's monster after monster for the crew of William Norling. The Bold Contender is heading back out to sea to the same location as the Minnamurra.
