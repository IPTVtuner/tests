Steve Rider presents coverage of the eighth round of the 2024 British Touring Car Championship on the famous Donington Park Grand Prix circuit - it's the second time the series has visited Donington this season after a rain-affected opening round where 2022 champion Tom Ingram came away with a brace of victories. Ingram has endured a rollercoaster year ever since then.
