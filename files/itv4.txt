Ed Chamberlin presents coverage of racing from Wetherby and Ascot and all the news ahead of the 2024 Breeders' Cup - the feature meeting of the afternoon is from Wetherby where the Charlie Hall Chase is one of the first big staying chases of the season with horses that will hopefully be Gold Cup contenders in 2025. There's also competitive racing from Ascot with the National Hunt course in action for the first time this season at the Berkshire track.
