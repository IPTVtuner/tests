Argentina have led the way for South American rugby for so long, but the emergence of Chile to play in their first-ever World Cup has been a real success story for the sport - the Condors notched up impressive qualifying wins against Canada and the USA and continue their Pool D campaign against Samoa, who have been mainstays at the tournament since 1991. David Flatman is joined in the studio by Maggie Alphonsi, George Gregan and John Barclay for coverage.
