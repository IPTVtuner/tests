The 2025 World Superbike Championship continues with the Motul Czech Round - the 4.212km track at the Autodrom Most will push the riders to their very limits as they look to get points on the board. This circuit first appeared on the WorldSBK calendar in 2021 and has become an instant classic due to its quirky layout leading to incredible late-race fights - thanks to its attractive event line-up, it is a popular destination for many motor enthusiasts and their families from across Europe.
