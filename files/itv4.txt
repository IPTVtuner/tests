The 2023 World Superbike Championship continues with the Tissot Aragon Round - the 5.077km track at MotorLand Aragon will push the riders to their very limits as they look to get points on the board. A truly state-of-the-art venue, the MotorLand Aragon road racing circuit was opened in 2009 to continue the rich local heritage of racing which had seen years of exciting street races in nearby Alcaniz, which hosted events between 1963 and 2003.
