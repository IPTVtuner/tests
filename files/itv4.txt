An anti-terrorism expert, who has taken early retirement and is about to start a new life, unwittingly becomes involved in an aeroplane hijack. While en route to LA and a new job after his wife's death, he finds himself on the same flight as an FBI-escorted terrorist who is on his way to stand trial. When the terrorist's cohorts take control of the plane, only he can save the passengers and crew.
