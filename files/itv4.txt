The 2024 World Superbike Championship continues with the Estoril Round - the 4.182km track at the Circuito Estoril will push the riders to their very limits as they look to get points on the board. The Circuito Estoril has previously been on the WorldSBK calendar twice - firstly in 1988 and then again in 1993 - is vast but technical, and features one of the longest straights on the calendar at just under one kilometre long.
