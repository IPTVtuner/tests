Mark Pougatch presents coverage of France's second match at the 2023 Rugby World Cup as they take on Uruguay in Lille - the tournament hosts will come into this game as favourites, but Fabien Galthie's side will be wary of the threat that Uruguay can pose after their famous 30-27 victory against Fiji at the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan. Studio analysis comes from Sean Fitzpatrick, Maggie Alphonsi and Gareth Thomas, and commentary is provided by Miles Harrison and Gordon D'Arcy.
