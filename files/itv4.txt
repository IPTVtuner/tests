Slapstick farce with the incompetent cops as they set about saving their beloved academy from closure. Cutbacks mean that only one of the two police training schools can stay open, so Commandant Lassard appeals to the motley crew of graduates to come and train new recruits. However, the rival academy intends to sabotage their plans by cutting their training time down to a minimum.
