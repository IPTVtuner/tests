Gary Imlach presents highlights from the second day of the 2024 Tour de France from Cesenatico to Bologna - the second stage is flatter than the first but has two big climbs in the final 40 kilometres that should see the climbers come to the fore. Commentary comes from Ned Boulting and David Millar.
