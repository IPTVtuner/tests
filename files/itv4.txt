Coverage of the penultimate round of the 2023 Kwik Fit British Touring Car Championship from Silverstone - with only six races remaining, three-time BTCC title winner Ash Sutton has a commanding 42-point lead at the top of the standings over 2022 champion Tom Ingram, who maintained his challenge with a ferocious display of driving last time out at Donington Park. After being demoted to third place in the first race there, Ingram drove brilliantly to take victory in the second race of the day.
