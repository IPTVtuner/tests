Motoring experts Vicki Butler-Henderson and Alex Riley go head to head championing what they think is the best British sports car to be realised in 1962. Vicki picks the ever popular MGB sports car while Alex makes a case for the ultra-lightweight Lotus Elan. A winner is picked by a panel of judges made up of former F1 driver and broadcaster Karun Chandhok, motoring author and vlogger Richard Porter and RM Sothebys car specialist and auctioneer Will Smith.
