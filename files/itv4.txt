Round 11 of the 2023 World Rally Championship is the WRC Rally Chile Bio Bio, which is technically complicated but also has fast and smooth-cambered roads in the forests surrounding the harbour city of Concepcion that are well-liked by drivers - at the same time, more open sections of the rally offer magnificent views of the Pacific Ocean for racing.
