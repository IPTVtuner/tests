Ali and Bobby head to Nottinghamshire to fish the River Trent for big barbel and have just 24 hours to succeed - Bobby has never even caught a barbel before, so can he break his duck? Ali then blindfolds Bob and drives him to a top-secret lake at a classified location - here they hope to catch some of the mysterious big carp that reside there. Two Michelin-starred chef Daniel is also smuggled into the venue, and he sets the lads a cooking competition to hopefully fuel them for further catches.
