Luke and his team have been contracted to remove two stolen vehicles from an abandoned mine site. The mine site has been turned into a recreational lake for weekend campers and water skiers. The missing cars are toxic and need to be removed. They have a 15,000-dollar budget and two days to get the job done. But there are problems: the location of the cars is unknown and the lake is overrun with holidaymakers. They'll need to employ commercial divers to search for the missing vehicles.
