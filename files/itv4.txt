A team of superannuated astronauts are rejected by NASA in the 1950s but find themselves in demand years later when a Russian satellite system malfunctions and plunges towards Earth. With only the original team knowing how to prevent the impending disaster, NASA begs them for help, but the men only agree on the condition that they are sent into space to carry out the mission themselves.
