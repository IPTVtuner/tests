Hugh Woozencroft presents coverage of Fiji against Portugal at the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France as the two sides play their final game of the pool stages in Toulouse - this is the first meeting between these two sides at the tournament and the first match between the two countries since Fiji's 36-13 win against Portugal in Lisbon back in 2013. Studio analysis comes from Rory Best, Nolli Waterman and Gareth Thomas, with commentary provided by Claire Thomas and Tom Shanklin.
