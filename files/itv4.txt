Ed Chamberlin presents coverage of a superb night of racing with all the action from Day Two of the 2023 Breeders' Cup from Santa Anita, California - the best chances of winners for the European hopefuls will come in the Turf, the Mile, and the Filly and Mare Turf, but the one race all the American team want to win is the showpiece event of the night, and that's the Breeders' Cup Classic. Analysis comes from Jason Weaver, Adele Mulrennan and Mark Johnson, and Oli Bell reports on the racing.
