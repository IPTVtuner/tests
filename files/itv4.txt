New crowd favourite Ripperoni offers a slice of its deadly pizza weapon to HiJinx, and Malice is determined to carve a victory against Valkyrie - meanwhile, the world's best flipper Hydra tries to finally hit the roof with Free Shipping. Elsewhere, it's a family affair when Blip meets its stablemate Tantrum - both bots are now desperate for a win after a poor start, and the gloves are off even though they have the same designer.
