The 2024 World Superbike Championship continues with the Tissot Aragon Round - the 5.077km track at MotorLand Aragon will push the riders to their very limits as they look to get points on the board. This venue owes its origins to a thrill-a-minute street circuit which ran through nearby Alcaniz from 1965 to 2003 - when safety concerns forced the end of racing on the streets, planning began in earnest for a permanent circuit to replace it.
