The Monster Carp team film their first-ever episode in the UK. The Wasing Estate in Berkshire has a number of lakes and was previously the home of the British record carp. Ali, Neil and Tom find it difficult to tempt the carp as this lake has been fished regularly by other anglers, and these old fish have seen everything over the years.
