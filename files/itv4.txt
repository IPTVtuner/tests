Ed Chamberlin presents coverage of racing from Warwick and Newbury - the feature meeting of the day is at Warwick, where the Classic Chase has been a key race ahead of the Grand National later in the season. There are also graded races for the novices as the hurdlers line up for the Leamington Spa Novices' Hurdle and the young chasers line up in the Hampton Novices' Chase, and there's competitive racing at Kempton too.
