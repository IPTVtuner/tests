On the opening night of the 2023-24 FA Cup First Round, Laura Woods presents coverage of Sheppey United against Walsall - Sheppey will be revelling in their first-ever appearance at this stage after coming through five preliminary ties. The Ites play in the eighth tier of English football - in the Isthmian League South East - and are the lowest-ranked side left in the Cup as they welcome League Two Walsall to Holm Park and Mat Sadler's side will be aiming to avoid a big Cup upset.
