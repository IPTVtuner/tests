A young rider is lucky to be alive after plunging down an unstable mineshaft on his motorbike. Team Salvage is in Kalgoorlie, the gold mining capital of Australia, to try and retrieve the damaged bike. They have five hours and a 4,500-dollar budget to compete this highly dangerous retrieval. The whole area is unstable and the bike is jammed 10-metres down a shaft.
