Safety Bay Beach in Western Australia has been hit by gale force winds and a vessel named Unhinged has been torn from its anchorage and washed ashore. This is the third time it has happened to the unlucky owner. Team Salvage has four hours and 5,000 dollars to re-float the vessel and tow it to a safe new mooring. Job two is a time-critical operation. The team responds to a caravan park in trouble with the law.
