Round Ten of the 2023 season is the WRC EKO Acropolis Rally Greece, where twisty gravel mountain roads combine with high temperatures and choking dust to provide a fierce challenge - the tracks are smoother than they used to be, but they still pose punishing demands on tyres and cars. The Acropolis Rally was first held in 1953 and was a founding member of the World Rally Championship in 1973, and the late Colin McRae was a master of this rally as he won it five times between 1996 and 2002.
