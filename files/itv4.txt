Ali Hamidi is joined by angling buddy Roo Abbott and diver Luc Boerrigter for a mission where they must catch a carp with the bite filmed on underwater cameras - the destination is Chase Lakes in France, a 12-acre gravel pit with 250 carp weighing as much as over 70 pounds, but the carp are playing hard to get in the tough spring conditions and constant tweaking of tactics is required after seeing how they are feeding.
