The intrepid trio continue their mission to track down the largest carp in the world, and find themselves in Slovenia, a country none of them have ever wet a line previously. Initially, Ali Hamidi, Neil Spooner and Tom Dove travel to a wild, remote lake called Vogrscek, which was created when the river was dammed and is full of submerged trees, so landing anything they hook is going to be a real challenge. Then it is off to a park lake which produced the Slovenian record of nearly 80lb.
