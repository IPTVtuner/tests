Ali Hamidi, Tom Dove and Neil Spooner have an Italian Job to complete, as they continue their adventure in the land of pizza and pasta. The three mates travel to a lake in the hills near Bologna, which is set amongst some stunning scenery, and they have heard tales that the fish here are just as impressive, but they only have a couple of days to try and catch one.
