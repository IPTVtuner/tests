On his return from the Crusades, Robin of Locksley learns that his father has been murdered by the tyrannical Sheriff of Nottingham and embarks on a campaign of guerrilla warfare to protect King Richard's throne. Fight scenes are lively and inventive, and a set piece fought under the forest canopy pulls out all the stops.
