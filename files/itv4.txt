Round Nine of the 2024 World Rally Championship is the WRC Secto Automotive Rally Finland - dating back to 1951 when it was launched as a means of deciding the Finnish entries for the Rallye Monte-Carlo, it took on the name 1000 Lakes Rally and was included in the calendar for the WRC in its first year in 1973. A mix of hard and wide roads with narrower and more technical sections - and flat out from start to finish - it is affectionately known as the Finnish Grand Prix.
