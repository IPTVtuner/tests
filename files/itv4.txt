Carp crusaders Ali Hamidi, Neil Spooner and Tom Dove venture to the true mecca of carp fishing - Lac de Saint-Cassien in France. Anglers have been travelling there from all over the world since the 1980s in search of the monsters that live in its depths. After growing up reading about this legendary venue, the lads finally get to make the pilgrimage to this hallowed water themselves, in the hope of catching one of its prizes.
