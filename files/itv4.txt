Gary Imlach presents highlights from the seventh stage of cycling's Criterium du Dauphine race - commentary comes from Ned Boulting and David Millar, and interviews are with reporter Daniel Friebe. The penultimate stage is the toughest of the 2025 edition as it crosses three mountains - including the Col de la Madeleine - between Grand-Aigueblanche and Valmeinier 1800.
