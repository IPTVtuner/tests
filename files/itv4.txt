Semra Hunter presents coverage of Mallorca against Real Madrid - it's the opening weekend in the 2024-25 LaLiga season and the defending champions are opening their campaign with a tough away fixture at the Estadi Mallorca Son Moix. Last season saw Carlo Ancelotti's side narrowly beat Mallorca thanks to a long-range goal from Aurelien Tchouameni - his deflected effort was enough to secure all three points and help Los Blancos move a step closer to the title.
