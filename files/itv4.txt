Round Three of the 2024 World Rally Championship is the Safari Rally Kenya - held on the untamed terrains of Africa's breath-taking landscapes where the weather can change in a matter of minutes, mud, rocks, fesh-fesh sand and challenging water crossings make it the ultimate test of endurance. The Safari Rally was first held in 1953 as the East African Coronation Safari in Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika and a celebration of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.
