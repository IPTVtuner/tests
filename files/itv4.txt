The Barralee is gearing-up to head back out to Maatsuyker Island for one last trip of winter the season. Skipper Danny, captain of the William Norling, is inching closer and closer to his target. The Bold Contender has stopped hunting for bid reds. Squizzy has switched back to searching for brindles. But will the switch pay off? Or is it all too little too late? At Middle Rocks, Clive, Skipper of the Minnamurra, is finally on a winning streak at last. If only Skipper Glenn could say the same.
