Two con men compete for the same patch on the French Riviera. The smooth English operator finds his territory invaded by a cocky American, and decides there is not room for the two of them in town. To regain his position, he proposes a wager - the first to fleece a glamorous heiress who has just arrived on the scene wins the right to stay, the loser moves on.
