Round Ten of the 2024 World Rally Championship is the WRC EKO Acropolis Rally Greece - first held in 1953, the rally was a founding member of the World Rally Championship in 1973 and regularly comprised more than 50 stages and 850 competitive kilometres in the 1970s. Hard base roads and high temperatures require careful management of tyres and cars and conditions are especially tricky on repeated stages when rocks and bedrock unearthed during the first pass can be especially damaging.
