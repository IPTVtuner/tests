Nicki Shields presents highlights of the best of the action from the fifth round of the 2024-25 Formula E season in Miami - the race at the Homestead-Miami Speedway follows an action-packed double-header in Jeddah in February 2025 which saw Brit Oliver Rowland enjoy an impressive weekend by finishing in second and first place across two races, and the Nissan driver will look to continue his fine run of form in Florida to extend his lead at the top of the championship.
