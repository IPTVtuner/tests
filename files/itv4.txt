In 1987 in the opening game of the inaugural Rugby World Cup, John Kirwan produced a moment of inspiration as he ran from deep within his half to score for New Zealand against Italy and ever since that day the tournament has been lit up by some truly memorable tries. Martin Bayfield looks back at twenty of the very best including All Black great Jonah Lomu giving England an almighty scare in 1995, Jason Robinson's World Cup final heroics in 2003, and more.
