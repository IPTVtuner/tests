Round Three of the 2025 World Rally Championship is the Safari Rally Kenya - held on the untamed terrains of Africa's breath-taking landscapes where the weather can change in a matter of minutes, mud, rocks, fesh-fesh sand and challenging water crossings make it the ultimate test of endurance. The Safari Rally was first held in 1953 as the East African Coronation Safari in Kenya.
