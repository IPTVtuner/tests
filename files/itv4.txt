Henry Cole and his partners Allen Millyard and Guy Willison are back on the road trawling Britain's sheds and auction houses for rusty relics to restore and sell on for a tidy profit - this time they delve into the many sheds of bike specialist Yeomans of Bromsgrove looking for a vintage British sled, take a 1200-pound punt on the contents of a van owned by top dealer Doug, and try to turn a profit at the Stratford Racecourse auto jumble.
