Oscar-winning drama based on the true story of the Apollo 13 space mission. The crew has almost reached the moon when an on-board explosion causes the spaceship to lose oxygen, power and guidance, and emergency rescue efforts begin at Mission Control in Houston. With just four days to bring the four astronauts back alive, and the world focused on their plight, there is no margin for error.
