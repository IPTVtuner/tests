Round Two of the 2024 British Rally Championship is the Rallynuts Severn Valley Stages, another newcomer to the BRC which marks the first of two gravel trips to Wales. Using classic stages from the Wales Rally GB archives, the Builth Wells-based event has been renamed for its 50th anniversary and offers a dynamic twist on its traditional format by offering up a longer and more challenging route which uses some of the best forest stages in the world.
