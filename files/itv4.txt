The 2025 World Superbike Championship begins with the Australian Round - the 4.445km track at the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit will push the riders to their very limits as they look to get their first points of the season on the board. The beautiful circuit on the Bass Strait off of the coast of Victoria in Australia is one of the most iconic and exciting venues in world motorsport - WorldSBK first raced at Phillip Island in 1990 just after the first MotoGP visit in 1989.
