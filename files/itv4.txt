A review of the 2023 British Touring Car Championship season that takes an in-depth look through all 30 rounds of a record-breaking year in the BTCC as Napa Racing's Ash Sutton was crowned Champion for a fourth time - this programme shows how the title was won and reflects on all ten race weekends in the calendar from the opening rounds at Donington Park to one chaotic weekend at Knockhill and from the finale at Brands Hatch to everywhere else in-between.
