Adventurous anglers Dean Macey and Adam Rooney venture to the Balkans to sample some fishing in Croatia, along with guest angler Gary Newman. Carp are the main focus of this week's challenges, and they begin their carp crusade at a prolific lake with a rare 30lb grass carp their target. Next, they venture onto a wild, rugged river which will test their combined skills to the absolute limit if they are to succeed in landing one of the huge king carp which can be found lurking there.
