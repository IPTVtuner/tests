Ed Chamberlin presents racing from Sandown, Hereford and Wolverhampton - the feature meeting of the day is at Sandown where the Imperial Cup is one of the big handicap hurdles of the season and the winner could land a hefty bonus should they go and win at the 2025 Cheltenham Festival. There is also plenty of competitive racing to support the feature at Sandown, action from Hereford over jumps, and two races on the all-weather surface at Wolverhampton.
