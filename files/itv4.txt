Vintage restorers Henry Cole and his mechanical genius of a best mate Sam Lovegrove are back on the memorabilia merry-go-round, challenging themselves to make money out of buying and selling other people's automotive junk and classic collectibles. Their buying spree begins at the Bristol Classic Car Show where they acquire one of the quirkiest cars of the 1970s. Henry's hoping for a small profit and a quick return, but as he soon discovers, making a fast buck is not so easy.
