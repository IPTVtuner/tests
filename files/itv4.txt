The team has been given just two days and a 20,000-dollar budget to remove a 10-metre steel-hulled yacht from Cockburn Beach in Western Australia. The problem is the boat is buried deep in the sand and it's a danger to beach goers. Heavy machinery specialist Ryan is going to use his monster excavator to try and get the job done. But there's a catch - to make the budget work, Luke needs Ryan to be done and dusted in 24 hours.
