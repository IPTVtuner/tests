Round Six of the 2024 World Rally Championship is the WRC Rally Italia Sardegna - another of the founding rounds from the championship's beginning in 1973, Italy's WRC event was formerly a mixed surface event based in San Remo before it moved to the Mediterranean island of Sardinia in 2004. Fast but narrow stages lined with bushes, trees and rocks on the edge leave no room for error, and the hard-base roads of the rally are covered by a sandy surface.
