Hugh Woozencroft presents coverage of Italy's second match at the 2023 Rugby World Cup as they take on Uruguay in Nice - these two sides have only played each other once before, and that was back in 2021 when the Azzurri claimed a narrow 17-10 win at home to register their first victory in over two years. Studio analysis comes from Sergio Parisse, Jamie Roberts and Nolli Waterman, with commentary from Claire Thomas and Tom Shanklin.
