Fishing crazy presenters Dean Macey and Adam Rooney are joined by England International angler Matt Godfrey as they head to Dorset. An overnight challenge on lake sees the lads target a 20lb carp. Then it's off to Portland Bill, where they're taken out of their comfort zone as they try their hand at a spot of sea fishing for a colourful specimen wrasse. The concluding challenge finds them on the Dorset Stour where they try to tempt a 5lb chub from the renowned Throop Fishery.
