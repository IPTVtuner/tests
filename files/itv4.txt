Gary Imlach presents coverage of action from the second day of the 2024 Tour de France from Cesenatico to Bologna - the second stage is flatter than the first but two big climbs in the final 40 kilometres should see the climbers come to the fore. Commentary comes from Ned Boulting and David Millar.
