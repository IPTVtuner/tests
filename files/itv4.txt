Action from the second round of the 2024 season as riders battle to become this year's world champion at the Grande Premio Tissot de Portugal which is taking place at the Autodromo Internacional do Algarve. Nestled in the beautiful setting of Portugal's Algarve, the 100,000-capacity venue - known more colloquially as Portimao after the port city it sits just outside of - was opened in November 2008 and inaugurated by WorldSBK when they headed to Portugal for their final round of that season.
