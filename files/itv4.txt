The first leg of The Tour of France sees the intrepid trio, Ali, Dovey and Spooner, head to the south of the country near Marseille, to a large natural lake called Carces. This tricky wild water, situated within rocky terrain, is rumoured by locals to hold several carp over the magical 70lb mark. This adventure is far from plain sailing as the team are faced with some huge physical and mental challenges - extreme weather conditions, heavy weed beds and giant catfish.
