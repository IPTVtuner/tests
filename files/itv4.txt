Hugh Woozencroft presents coverage of the 2023 Rugby World Cup as Uruguay take on Namibia at the OL Stadium in Lyon - these two sides faced each other in an international friendly in August 2023, and it was Uruguay that came out on top with a 26-18 win in Montevideo. This match is Namibia's last game in Pool A, but their opponents' final pool match is against New Zealand, a game that is also being hosted at the OL Stadium in Lyon.
