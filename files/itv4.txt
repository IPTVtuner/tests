The winter lobster season is in full swing. Squizzy, Skipper of Bold Contender, is under pressure to fill a special order of 600 brindle lobsters. Ansons Bay is dead in the water - its engine has stopped working, and stormy weather and rough seas have plagued the Minnamurra. It's been a horror start for Skipper Clive. Meanwhile, Danny, Skipper of the William Norling, is hunting for big reds in the Bass Strait and he's received some good news. The all in price of lobsters has spiked.
