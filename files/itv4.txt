Ed Chamberlin presents coverage of racing from Lingfield, Ascot and Haydock - the feature meeting of the day is at Lingfield where trials for the 2024 Oaks and Derby take centre stage and are likely to throw up some Classic clues. Elsewhere, the feature race of the day at Ascot is the Victoria Cup and there's a very competitive handicap hurdle at Haydock - analysis comes from Luke Harvey and Megan Nicholls, reporting from Oli Bell and Sally Ann Grassick, and commentary from Mark Johnson.
