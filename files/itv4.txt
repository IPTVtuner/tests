Senator William Tadlock gives up the senate to lead a wagon train to Oregon, along with the train's scout and a restless settler who is always wondering what's around the next bend. They encounter the normal perils - hostile Indians, raging rivers - but the film also shows the diverse mixture of those seeking a new life, and the photography captures the grandeur of the untamed West.
