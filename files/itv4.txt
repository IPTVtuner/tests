The team heads to the seaside town of Rockingham in Western Australia to try and salvage a 34-foot yacht called the Renee Louise. It's run aground and the owner has gone AWOL. With a major tourist event kicking off in three days, the local council is desperate to get the vessel off the beach - it's an eyesore and it's dangerous. The team has two days to get the job done.
