Action from the 17th round of the season as riders look to secure vital championship points at the OR Thailand Grand Prix, which is taking place at the Chang International Circuit - designed by German architect Hermann Tilke, the Buriram International Circuit opened in 2014 and is sited about 410 kilometres northeast of the Thai capital of Bangkok. The town of Buriram's name literally translates as 'city of happiness', and its typically hot and humid weather is a key feature of its location.
