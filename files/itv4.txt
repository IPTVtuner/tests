Round 11 of the 2024 World Rally Championship is the WRC Rally Chile Bio Bio - a relative newcomer to the WRC, the Rally Chile Bio BÃ­o was first held in 2018 when it ran as a candidate event as part of a bid to join the WRC calendar. Its success meant that Chile was added to the WRC calendar for 2019 - at the time becoming the 32nd country to host a WRC round since the championship's inception in 1973.
