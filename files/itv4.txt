Steve Rider presents coverage as the 2025 British Touring Car Championship continues with Rounds 13, 14 and 15 from Oulton Park - the title race is heating up at the halfway point of the season after Tom Ingram's first win of the season at Thruxton cut Ash Sutton's championship lead down to nine points. Expert punditry at the picturesque Cheshire race circuit comes from Tim Harvey, Paul O'Neill and Jade Edwards, Louise Goodman reports from the pit lane, and commentary comes from David Addison.
