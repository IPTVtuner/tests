Vicki Butler-Henderson and Alex Riley are tasked with championing a sports saloon car that was born in 1963. Vicki goes for the original touring car for the road in the shape of the Ford Lotus Cortina, while Alex picks the Alfa Romeo Giulia GT, Ford's arch rival on the race track. Only one car can win, and that decision is made by an expert panel of judges in the form of former F1 driver and broadcaster Karun Chandhok, classic car auctioneer Nick Wells, and RM Sotheby's car expert Will Smith.
