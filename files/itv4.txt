Ed Chamberlin presents action from Ascot, Newmarket and Redcar on a busy day of Flat racing as its season enters its last few weeks - the feature race of the day is the Group One Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket, where some of the top fillies clash over a straight mile. There's also the richest race of the season at Redcar, where a big field line up in the Two-Year-Old Trophy, and four competitive races at Ascot too.
