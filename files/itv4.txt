Action from the first round of the 2024 season as riders battle to become this year's world champion at the Qatar Airways Grand Prix of Qatar which is taking place at the Lusail International Circuit. This fabulous venue lies on the outskirts of Doha, the capital city of Qatar, and was built in little over a year - the track cost 58 million dollars and required round-the-clock dedication from almost 1,000 workers to get it ready for the 2004 Marlboro Grand Prix of Qatar that inaugurated it.
