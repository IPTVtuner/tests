Hugh Woozencroft is joined by Jamie Roberts, Benjamin Kayser, and Topsy Ojo for coverage as the two most successful teams in Champions Cup history meet in the final for the first time with five-time winners Toulouse facing four-time winners Leinster at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Leinster have suffered of late in the competition - despite their rich pedigree - losing successive finals to La Rochelle, but Leo Cullen's side have looked in imperious form this season.
