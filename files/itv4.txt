Jeremy Wade goes deep into the forbidding Alaskan wilderness to visit two large lakes where legend has it people have been vanishing without trace for hundreds of years. Jeremy cannot resist a challenge and is intrigued to see if there is a native species of lake monster that has actually been pulling fishermen into the icy depths. This is new territory for him, as he has never done any sub-Arctic fishing before.
