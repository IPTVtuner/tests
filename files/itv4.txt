Newcomer Steve Hursey is pulling his first shot of the winter run, and there's a lot riding on it. The Hursey family's sea-to-plate restaurant is low on lobster stocks, and it's Steve's job to re-fill them. He's fishing around Hunter Island, an area known for giant reds and howling westerly winds, but weather is the least of Steve's worries. The rope line to one of his pots is tangled, and it's threatening to pull deckhand Jamie overboard.
