The team is driving to Kalgoorlie, the gold mining capital of Australia, to salvage a 10-tonne gold dry-blower that's been sitting idle for months now and is costing its owner hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue. With the price of gold skyrocketing, the owner wants to get the blower repaired and back out onto the goldfields. But he can't. It's stuck in the middle of nowhere. The team has one day and a budget of 20,000 dollars to retrieve the money making gold machine.
