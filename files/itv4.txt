Round Three of the 2024 British Rally Championship is the highly-regarded Beatson's Building Supplies Jim Clark Rally - this legendary closed-road event held in the Scottish Borders will offer increased mileage for this year that includes a longer opening leg on the first night of the rally before a daylight blast on the second day that is the perfect opportunity for a BRC duel.
