The second series kicks off with fishing-mad Dean Macey and Adam Rooney travelling to the Rio Ebro in Spain. Their mission is to target specimen roach and carp, and concludes with the challenging task of catching a giant wels catfish. They will need to use all of their skill if they are to succeed, not to mention their strength if they are to tame one of these river beasts. To help them on their final leg of their journey, they are joined by globetrotting big fish angler, Gary Newman.
