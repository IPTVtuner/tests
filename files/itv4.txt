Round Four of the 2024 World Rally Championship is the WRC Croatia Rally - a newcomer to the WRC in 2021, the Croatia Rally has proved itself to be a huge challenge with ever-changing grip levels and surface conditions characterising the first world-level rally in Europe's eastern region since the Rally Bulgaria in 2010. The sealed surface special stages are slippery even in the dry while the asphalt varies from super-smooth via worn to badly broken.
