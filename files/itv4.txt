The team has been booked to refloat a pre-World War II vessel named Emily Rose. Heavy machinery specialist Ryan transports Christopher the Winch Beast to the job. But on route, Luke receives an emergency SOS - a fishing boat has capsized off the coast of Mindarie in Western Australia. The boat's owner and his nephew have been rushed to hospital and the boat is now missing. With Ryan halfway to the first job, a land-based retrieval is not an option.
