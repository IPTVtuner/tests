Steve Rider presents coverage of the seventh round of the 2024 British Touring Car Championship from Knockhill in Scotland - this season's title race is proving to be one of the most exciting in recent years after an eventful weekend at Croft last time out. The opening race was won by King of Croft Colin Turkington who claimed his 70th race win, but the four-time champion finished down the field in Races Two and Three after collisions with other drivers.
