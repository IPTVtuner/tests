Matt Barbet presents highlights from the fifth stage of the 2024 Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men with commentary from Ned Boulting and David Millar - riders on this stage will tackle the final pair of categorised King of the Mountains climbs of the 2024 race at Newnham Hill and Bullshill, just south of Daventry, and an intermediate sprint at Holcot at the eastern end of the Pitsford Water causeway. The stage then heads west onto a loop south of Northampton.
