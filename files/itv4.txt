Tiff heads to the dreamy roads of Wales in the ultimate fast Ford, before unleashing it on track to see if it lives up to its racing roots. Meanwhile, it's time for a sand-slinging, mud-flinging face-off as the Range Rover takes on the BMW X7 - two of the most luxurious SUVs money can buy. Also on the show, Tiff explores Lamborghini country with racing driver Vicky Piria and the new Hurac√°n Evo, while Sid North takes a look at the world's best-selling electric vehicle.
