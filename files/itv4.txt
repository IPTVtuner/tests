Gary Imlach presents highlights from the sixth stage of cycling's 2025 Paris-Nice race, with commentary from Ned Boulting and David Millar and pre- and post-race interviews from reporter Daniel Freibe - this is the longest stage of the race, and another chance for the sprinters to claim a stage win, as 209.8 kilometres are covered between Saint-Julian-en-Saint-Alban and Berre l'Etang on the Mediterranean coast.
