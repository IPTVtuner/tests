The 2023 World Superbike Championship continues with the Pirelli French Round - the 4.411km track at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours will push the riders to their very limits as they look to get points on the board. The Magny-Cours circuit first appeared on the WorldSBK calendar for a single year in 1991, but it has been a regular fixture since 2003 as the series makes the journey each season to the 90,000-capacity venue some 250 kilometres to the south of Paris.
