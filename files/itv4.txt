Seema Jaswal presents coverage alongside Jobi McAnuff and former Millwall manager Gary Rowett as Millwall face Dagenham and Redbridge in the third round of the 2024-25 FA Cup - the London derby is the sides' first meeting in 13 years after Millwall's 5-0 victory over the Daggers at the same stage of the Cup in 2012. It's all change at Millwall with Neil Harris stepping down as manager - the Championship side will therefore be looking to avoid a potential slip-up against Dagenham and Redbridge.
