A rugged cattle baron takes on an unscrupulous entrepreneur who is determined to subdue the people of Pecos, New Mexico, and take over the cattleman's land. Loosely based on true accounts of bloody territorial conflicts in the late 19th century, the story brings a number of legendary figures from western history into the action, including Billy the Kid and Pat Garrett.
