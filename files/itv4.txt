This episode sees the return of Deathroll - the 'Aussie Assassin' that punches its blood-soaked fist in victory every time it destroys an opponent - as they face the British bot destroyer Cobalt, plus bot legend Donald Hutson coming back to try to resurrect Lock-Jaw's reputation after a disappointing display in the sixth series when he faces Bunny Sauriol and her fearsome bot Malice.
