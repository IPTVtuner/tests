Francesca Cumani presents coverage of racing from Haydock and Beverley - the feature meeting of the day is at Haydock where the Group Three Lester Piggott Stakes and John O'Gaunt Stakes are the highlights, and there's also action from Beverley where juveniles will be looking to book a place at Royal Ascot in the two feature contests there. Analysis comes from Jason Weaver and Adele Mulrennan, reporting from Oli Bell and Sally Ann Grassick, and commentary from Richard Hoiles.
