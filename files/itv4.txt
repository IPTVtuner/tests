Francesca Cumani and Ed Chamberlin present action from the opening day of the 2023 Future Champions Festival at Newmarket, plus racing from York and Chepstow - the highlight of the day is at Newmarket, where five top-class races take centre stage with the Group One Fillies' Mile likely to have an impact on 2024's Classic races, and there's also action from Chepstow at the start of the National Hunt season with the Grade Two Persian War Novices' Hurdle.
