Highlights from the fourth stage of the 2024 Paris-Nice cycling race, a 183-kilometre race from Chalon-sur-Saone to Mont Brouilly that includes seven climbs and ends on a punchy finishing circuit in the Beaujolais region - the climb to the line is three kilometres long with the final kilometre at a gradient of just over nine per cent.
