Ali, Dovey and Spooner head to the north east of France near to Reims, to Crete Lakes - a prestigious and well-known water that holds colossal carp up to an incredible 85lbs. The challenge here is for Dovey to catch a long overdue 70lb carp - If he fails, he must jump in the icy cold lake, but if he succeeds, then Ali and Spoons will have to get their budgie smugglers on and dive in! The lads all catch huge carp, but will Dovey do enough to finally join the exclusive 70s club?
