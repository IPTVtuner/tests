Set in a lawless, post-apocalyptic wilderness. To retrieve his camel train, hero Max enters the seedy, savage, rough-hewn precincts of Bartertown. Forced to fight for his possessions, he breaks the only rule of the city and is banished. In the desert, he is rescued by a tribe of feral children who see him as a prophesied saviour.
