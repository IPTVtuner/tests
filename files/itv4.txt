A vivid and harrowing depiction of war which follows a 19-year-old college dropout who signs up for service in Vietnam in September 1967, and finds himself plunged into the bloody chaos of life as a GI on the front line. The winner of four Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Picture, this is an uncompromising and semi-autobiographical study of men at war from writer-director Oliver Stone.
