Greenhorn Skipper Bryce is up to his eyeballs in debt. After buying a new boat for $150,000 and spending a further $90,000 refurbishing it, the cash-strapped rookie can't afford a deckhand and embarks on his maiden voyage solo. Skipper Squizzy and Tabor are halfway through their five-day run. Squizzy has had to re-mortgage his house to keep his business afloat. They have just 48 hours to hit their target, and then comes the hard part: selling 500kg of lobsters direct to punters.
