The second leg of the UK tour sees Ali and Bobby attempt to catch a monster shark over 400lbs from just off the north Devon coast. The boys actually hook the biggest shark they've ever seen and have to tag team on the rod to try and get the sea beast to the boat. They then venture to Norfolk in pursuit of Britain's biggest freshwater predator - the wels catfish. The duo's mission is to catch a giant over 50lbs. Chef Daniel Clifford also pays the lads another visit for a bank side cook-a-long.
