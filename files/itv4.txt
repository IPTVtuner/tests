It's one of the most eagerly anticipated fixtures of the Gallagher Premiership season, particularly in the West Country, as local rivals Bath take on Bristol at the Recreation Ground - Bath began the 2024-25 season with an impressive victory over Northampton that gained a modicum of revenge for their painful defeat in last season's final at Twickenham, while Bristol also kicked off their campaign in style with a thumping 24-3 win over Newcastle at Kingston Park.
