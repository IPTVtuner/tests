The 2025 World Superbike Championship continues with the Pirelli Dutch Round - the 4.542km track at the TT Assen Circuit will push the riders to their very limits as they look to get points on the board. 'The Cathedral' of motorcycle racing as it is colloquially known, Assen has an almost unrivalled history in motorsport as it is the only venue to have held a round of the MotoGP World Championship every year since its creation in 1949 with the exception of 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
