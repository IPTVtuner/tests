Ali Hamidi and Bobby Zamora's bucket list fishing tour begins in central Spain on the wild Guadiana River in the centre of the country - their mission is to catch Ali's childhood dream fish of the rare comizo barbel with a target weight of over ten pounds. The boys then head to Lake Proserpina near Merida, an urban lake built by the Romans - the mission here is for them both to catch a winter carp weighing over 30 pounds.
