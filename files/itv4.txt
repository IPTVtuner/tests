As the 1980-81 season got under way there was plenty of excitement on the South Coast due to Kevin Keegan's return to English football with Southampton, after his three-year Bundesliga adventure with Hamburg. The Dell was packed to the rafters to see Keegan line up alongside his old sparring partner Mick Channon as Lawrie McMenemy's Saints took on Manchester City. Elsewhere, champions Liverpool faced Crystal Palace and Sunderland entertained Everton at Roker Park.
