The 2024 World Superbike Championship continues with the Pirelli Emilia-Romagna Round - the 4.226km track at the Misano World Circuit 'Marco Simoncelli' will push the riders to their very limits as they look to get points on the board. Along with circuits such as Phillip Island, Assen and Donington Park, this is one of the 'classic' WorldSBK venues with the championship having visited the Italian track very consistently over the decades.
