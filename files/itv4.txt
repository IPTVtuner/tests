Habit-wearing sleuth Cadfael is called in to investigate when a wealthy landowner, who cut his son out of his will to leave his inheritance to Shrewsbury Abbey, is found poisoned. The dashing monk discovers that the man's wife is the childhood sweetheart he has not seen for 40 years. Cadfael had promised he would be back to marry her after leaving for the crusades, but never returned to honour his pledge.
