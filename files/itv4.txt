Ed Chamberlin and Francesca Cumani present coverage from Newmarket and Cheltenham. The Flat racing comes from Newmarket where the Nell Gwyn Stakes is the feature race and will hopefully see a key contender for the 1,000 Guineas emerge. Chief supporting races include the Feilden Stakes and the Earl of Sefton Stakes - meanwhile, the highlight at Cheltenham is the Silver Trophy over the jumps.
