School's out. Dane, Junior, Bishop, and Bayo want to make the most of their summer. Dane's old friend Kai has an idea about how. Armed with fake IDs and fake bravado, they sneak in to Knights of the Realm, the rave of the summer. The boys are awestruck by the wall-to-wall designer labels, the famous faces, the music, and the girls - one girl in particular for Dane (and Kai).
