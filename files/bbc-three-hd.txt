Louis Theroux investigates the world of extreme bodybuilding and, after a brief work-out with a leading amateur, realises - not surprisingly - that he is not destined to be a body builder. Instead, Louis joins a group of men obsessed with female muscle. Cast as the villain in a muscle worship video, he is then beaten up by a muscular woman.
