It's a Sunday and Becky and Steve are bored. Their fridge is broken and Becky's parents are coming round to fix it. Steve has never met them before and he's terrified. When they arrive, he's over-friendly and a bit odd. Matters are only made worse by Dan, who is audibly enjoying himself upstairs with his alleged new girlfriend, Paris.
