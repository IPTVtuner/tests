Jack is an unfulfilled actor. Desperate for some meaningful work, he agrees to join fellow actor Lauren on an pantomime tour of the North East. Just one catch: it's an off-season tour of dementia homes, where the audience tend to be more interested in daytime TV than in Jack and Lauren's contemporary interpretation of Alice in Wonderland.
