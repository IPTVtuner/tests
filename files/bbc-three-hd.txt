This powerful documentary follows pop star Leigh-Anne Pinnock as she confronts her experience as the only black member of Little Mix, and as a black woman in the music industry. Leigh-Anne talks about the racism she experienced growing up. Both her parents are of Caribbean heritage, and Leigh-Anne identifies as black. She is also aware that having lighter skin and being a celebrity means she is in a more privileged position than others.
