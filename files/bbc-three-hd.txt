Lorna's best friend Connie is round for dinner and self-appointed guru Cuckoo manages to motivate her to leave Steve and pursue her childhood dream of becoming a singer. The only cloud on the horizon is the fact that Connie's voice is horrible. Ken survives three days listening to the caterwauling harpie before he realises it's time to act.
