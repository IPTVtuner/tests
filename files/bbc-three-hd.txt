It's the morning after the Pride before and the boys are reeling from the fallout of 'Hurricane Mikey' - the single Scouse who's already turning heads. In the eye of the storm are Ben and Josh, who both feel there could be something there? Josh thinks about his next move after he and Bobski fail to launch, while Ben tries to get to know the real Ollie - the man behind the tash. Having been 'ditched' on day one, Bobski decides to up his game and explore his chemistry with another boy.
