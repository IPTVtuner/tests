Daisy Maskell, the UK's youngest ever breakfast radio host, has suffered from insomnia since childhood. For as long as she can remember, she has survived on as little as a couple of hours of sleep each night and is wide awake until the early hours of the morning. With an ever-increasing workload, running on empty is starting to take its toll, so Daisy wants to uncover the roots of her insomnia and take the first steps towards treatment. She is not alone.
