Some relationships are thriving, others are barely surviving, and just when the girls are starting to find their feet, the path to love takes an unexpected turn. Dannii presents the girls three pillars - each representing a core relationship pillar. The girls are asked to stand by the pillar they feel is most important to them. Dannii then makes a shocking announcement: she didn't choose these pillars... they were chosen by three new girls - new girls who are arriving right now.
