The three funboys, Callum Brown, Jordan McCafferty and Lorcan Boggin, may have taken the scenic route through emotional development but they're trying to make the most of life in rural Ballymacnoose. While working at the local shop, Callum acquires his first-ever female admirer in the form of Gemma, who is new to town and seeking friends. Unfortunately, Callum's burgeoning relationship means that he no longer wants to play video games all weekend with the fellas.
