Four fierce rookie cooks have reached the semi-final and tonight, it's game-on with two of the toughest challenges so far. The mission is simple: impress judges Poppy O'Toole and Big Has with some of the best food yet and be rewarded with a ticket to the Young MasterChef Final. One mistake, and it could be game-over. Our chefs must whack on the wellies, as tonight's semi-final kicks off in the countryside, where the coals are being fired up for a celebrity bash like no other.
