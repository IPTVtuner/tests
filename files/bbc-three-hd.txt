A colony of emperor penguins gather in Atka Bay, on the coast of Antarctica, after three months feeding at sea. They arrive as the sea freezes over and all the other Antarctic animals have left the continent for the relative safety of the sea. The penguins have come here to raise the next generation in their emperor's dynasty, but to do so they will have to work together to keep themselves and their chicks alive through the coming winter: the coldest and cruellest on earth.
