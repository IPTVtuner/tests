A married father-of-two from a neighbourhood on the outskirts of Toronto leaves for work one day and never returns. The mystery deepens when his car is found on the other side of the city in a quiet neighbourhood. With no answers, two years later another man disappears. Both missing men were originally from Afghanistan, and like the first victim, Skanda, they were also brown-skinned.
