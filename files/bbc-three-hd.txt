Sports mockumentary about GB Paralympian Darren Silverstone, who stole the hearts of a nation before his infamous chokey-o in Tokyo. For the first time, he tells his story - and starts his glorious comeback. In Tokyo 2020, Darren Silverstone was the Paras GB poster boy. (He was on yoghurts, too.) He cruised to the final and charmed the nation along the way with his signature dance move, the dazzle.
