Two basketball heavyweights go head-to-head in Boston as the Celtics look to get revenge for a 132-126 overtime defeat to the Golden State Warriors in December. The Warriors star man Stephen Curry scored 33 points during their victory in San Francisco to end the Celtics' five-game winning streak. The sides also met in the 2022 NBA finals, with Golden State triumphing 4-2 in the seven-game series to claim a fourth championship in eight years.
