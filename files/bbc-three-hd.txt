On their way to meet their source, Billy, Con and Zoe get lost in middle England, where they hope to make the tape exchange that will complete their cult VHS collection. When they get a lift from an erratic stranger, it only sends them further off course as Con tries and fails to keep the peace between Billy and Zoe. Deep in the woods, they realise they may not be alone.
