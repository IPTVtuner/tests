Claudia Winkleman greets a group of strangers as they arrive at a beautiful castle in the Scottish Highlands to play the ultimate prestige reality game of detection, backstabbing and trust, all in the hope of winning up to Â£120,000. And it's not long before the players are questioning everything, and everyone, as Claudia secretly assigns the Traitors. Their task is simple. Under the cover of darkness, they must pick off their fellow players one by one, murdering them out of the game.
