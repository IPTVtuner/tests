It's the grand finale! The time has come for the competition to conclude as RuPaul's finalist queens compete in their final challenge - an all-singing, all-dancing extravaganza to fight for the crown. Choreographer Aaron Renfree coaches the queens as they write and perform a winner's song that's worthy of great TV talent show finales. And, as ever, it's a family line-up for the show, with Michelle Visage, Alan Carr, Graham Norton and last year's winner and reigning champion, Ginger Johnson.
