Timothy, 19, from Bradford is on his third tag and is awaiting trial for robbery. His GPS tag excludes him from going into the city centre, which makes getting to college and probation meetings difficult and time-consuming. As an aspiring rap artist, Timothy hopes to keep out of trouble and make a career in music, but having already breached his tag by accidentally straying into his exclusion zone, staying away from town where his friends and studios are based is proving a challenge.
