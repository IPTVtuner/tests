Nessa and the Wests head east, with some help from Dave and his coach. Meanwhile in Essex, Dawn and Pete visit for drinks, Mick is preoccupied with his new love, and Smithy cannot wait to spend his first Christmas with Neil the Baby. Pam has prepared a lovely spread and Bryn has his mistletoe ready, but as the Christmas spirit gets a grip, Gavin and Stacey have a startling announcement to make.
