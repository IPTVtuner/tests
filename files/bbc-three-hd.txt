Gemma attends birthing classes led by a very eccentric antenatal teacher. Realising she needs more support, she seeks advice from her aunt Jess, Malcolm's sister. She and Malcolm get invited to Jess and her domineering husband Tyrone's new house for a party, but Malcolm is scared of Tyrone, who intimidates him with his new hot tub.
