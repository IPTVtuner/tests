Our six teams are primed and ready for battle. From the far reaches of the UK - with tractors big, small and medium - these tractor-mad young farmers can't wait to show off their skills and agility. They're eyeing up the opposition and there's no end of fighting talk. Who has what it takes to win this round and avoid the tractor-off elimination? Staying safe is the name of this game, and it can all change in a heartbeat. First up is the bale baton relay race - a test of speed and precision.
