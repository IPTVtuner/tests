Sian is frustrated that she still hasn't been able to contact the Gower family who lived at the farmhouse - David, a former headmaster, his wife Rose-Mary and their son John-Paul. But there is a breakthrough of another kind when the current owner of Penyffordd Farm gets in touch and invites her over to see the house she's heard so much about. Sian is welcomed in by Michael, who bought the house in Flintshire from the Gowers despite stories that it was haunted.
