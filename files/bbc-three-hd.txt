It is the day of the Abbey Grove school field trips and Alfie and Gulliver are escorting their pupils to a petting zoo and ink museum. Fraser takes his group of pupils to a `poetry recital' which turns out to be a rap battle, and Pickwell decides to take her class to an abattoir. Things go from bad to worse, when Alfie takes an opportunity to hijack his field trip and turn it into a Bear Grylls-esque survival course.
