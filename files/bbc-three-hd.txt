It's Christmas at Button House and Mike and Alison are heading to Mike's parents to celebrate with family. As Mike piles up the Tupperware with what he insists are only side dishes, despite one clearly being an entire turkey, Kitty expresses her disappointment at not spending Christmas day with Alison. Alison promises that they'll be back by the evening and what's more, reveals to the ghosts that there is a Christmas surprise for each of them in the library.
