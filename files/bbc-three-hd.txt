The phantom-fighters return to the streets of New York when they come to the aid of a woman who fears that her baby is the target of ghostly forces. Four years after Dr Peter Venkman broke up with Dana Barrett, she appeals for help to save her son when an arch-demon trapped in an oil painting wants to take over his body. The old team reunite and trace the source of the trouble to a sinister underground river of slime.
