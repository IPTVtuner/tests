Award-winning journalist Mobeen Azhar investigates the story of Gurvin Singh, a 20-year-old medical student who one evening near Christmas decided to hand out free cash to unsuspecting strangers in Plymouth town centre. He told the local paper that he was `giving back to the community', having made thousands of pounds through forex trading. But weeks later rumours were rife that Gurvin's trading claims were a scam.
