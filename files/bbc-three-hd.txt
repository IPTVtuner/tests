Paul's son, Little Luke, is out of hospital so he's having a fancy dress party to celebrate. Steve and Becky have to go, but they don't want to. Becky dithers over a spot on her chin. Steve can't get through to his bank. When a furious Paul comes over to see why they're so late and what's happened to the sausage rolls, it seems they have no option but to go.
