It's the third quarter-final, and the battle for this week's semi-final places reaches its climax. The three remaining celebrities must cook a faultless two-course meal that will be judged not only by John and Gregg but also by three Celebrity MasterChef legends: actors Sophie Thompson (2014 champion) and John Partridge (2018 champion) and TV personality Vicky Pattison (2019 finalist).
