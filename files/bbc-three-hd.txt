In the second series, Becky and Steve's relationship blossoms above the nitty gritty of living together, but there's trouble on the horizon. Laura and Shelley have job interviews at Boots, organised by Steve's ex-girlfriend, who's a bit too interested in Steve. Meanwhile, Dan's back with his girlfriend and is more miserable than ever, while Paul's up to his old tricks again.
