In January 2014, in small American town, 18-year-old boy Justin Back is brutally murdered in his own home. Two friends - 19-year-old Austin Myers and 19-year-old Tim Mosley are arrested and charged with his murder. Both give very different stories. Which one is telling the truth? What will each one do to save themselves from the ultimate punishment - the death penalty? With access to the filmed confessions of both boys, this film shines a disturbing light on the American criminal justice system.
