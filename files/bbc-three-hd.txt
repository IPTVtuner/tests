The Young MasterChef final five are back to show judges Poppy and Kerth their sweet side in the form of an ice cream parlour challenge. Not just any old ice cream but a complex ice cream dessert that will have customers queueing round the block. Joined by award-winning ice cream sandwich wizard Terri Mercieca, the cooks must show the three judges that they can dabble in pastry and come up with a dessert worthy of gracing the menu of the best ice cream joint in town.
