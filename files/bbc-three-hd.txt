Three weeks after we last saw her, and six weeks after leaving prison, Miri Matteson is optimistic about her future. Her probation officer, Janice, has gotten her a trial shift at the supermarket, she and her neighbour Billy have been spending more time together, and she has found her crimper. However, Miri is still not talking to her mother Caroline after the revelation that she was having an affair with Miri's ex-boyfriend Dom.
