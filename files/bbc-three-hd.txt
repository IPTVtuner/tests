Chi spectacularly fails a trial period at the pharmacy with Karen, but Dave kindly lets her shadow him on his delivery rounds. On a drop-off to a retirement home Chi finds her tribe... old people. She also falls in love with Linda, an elderly lady who seems to think Chi is her husband. Elsewhere, Dave has a health scare, and Karen starts to think she might be the fertility issue.
