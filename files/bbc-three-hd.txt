It's Day 21 and the morning after a dramatic evaluation. With the final now in sight, who might be tempted to ditch their teammate in favour of the newly-available Warrior? In the Coach's challenge, Fight the Fire, some key rivals face off, with dramatic results, and one trainee shows a spirit that's been missing, before falling at the final hurdle. Day 23 is Fire Power Challenge day, and Feel the Burn is the toughest endurance challenge yet for the pairs.
