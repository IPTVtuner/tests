It's the semi final! As we reach the penultimate week, RuPaul's search for the UK's Next Drag Race Superstar is nearly over.

The crown is in snatching distance, but one wrong joke could mean game over for one of our plucky contenders. Thankfully, Alan Carr is on hand to mentor the queens with a comedy masterclass.
