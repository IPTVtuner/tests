Zara McDermott discovers that Gaia's alleged attacker contacted her ten months before she went missing. As her older sister Clara says, the texts were 'inherently threatening' and triggered a mental health crisis. As her attempts to get a restraining order were declined, Gaia spiralled. Within a month of receiving the texts, Gaia was in hospital, sectioned under the Mental Health Act for her own safety.
