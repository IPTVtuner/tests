It's near the end of term at Abbey Grove, and Alfie is prepping for a careers presentation, really just an excuse to reunite all the old Class K and have a big party. Meanwhile Stephen has been teaching at Abbey Grove for six months, but none of his old schoolfriends know this. He has been maintaining the fiction that he is now a musical theatre star on the rise and tells his pupils, the new Class K, that they cannot blow his cover.
