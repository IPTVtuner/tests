Steve and Becky are drunk and arguing. They storm back into the flat, soon followed by their even drunker friends and Jamie, Becky's oldest friend. While everyone helps themselves to his food and drinks, Steve tries in vain to deal with Becky and her close friendship with Jamie. Eventually he can't take it anymore and locks Becky in the bathroom.
