At just 22, Louis Rees-Zammit is one of the hottest properties in rugby. Blessed with frightening pace, dazzling footwork, and Hollywood good looks, he is a poster boy for a rugby-obsessed nation. With unfiltered access, this documentary follows the Welsh rugby star on and off the pitch as he builds towards the Rugby World Cup, his chance to shine on the biggest stage in his sport. Capped for Wales at just 18, he secured a lucrative contract with Gloucester, one of the top clubs in England.
