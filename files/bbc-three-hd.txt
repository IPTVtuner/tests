Becky and Steve's relationship blossoms above the nitty gritty of living together, but there's trouble on the horizon. Laura and Shelly have job interviews organised by Steve's ex-girlfriend, Dan's back with his girlfriend and is more miserable than ever, and Paul's up to his old tricks again. Elsewhere, Becky and Steve are late for the cinema and keep getting delayed. They lock themselves out and Steve can't find his phone.
