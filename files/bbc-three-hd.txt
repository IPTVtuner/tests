The race to St John's continues as the five pairs leave the gold rush boom town of Dawson City and head south to the third checkpoint, 2,700 km away in the province of Alberta - the picturesque resort town of Banff. Perched in the Rocky Mountains, 4,500 feet above sea level, Banff is the highest town in Canada, and in this leg, there is a need for speed as the team who reach the checkpoint last will be eliminated from the race.
