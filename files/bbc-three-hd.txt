Stay-at-home-daughter Chi is suddenly forced to fend for herself when her parents die in a car crash. Chi learns she will only inherit the house on condition she completes a list of 'Things You Should Have Done' left in the parents' will, the first of which is, ironically, learn to drive. Meanwhile, Chi's highly strung auntie Karen wants nothing to do with her dependent pest of a niece, but very much wants the house she feels is rightfully hers.
