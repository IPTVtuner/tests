Jeremy Clarkson attempts to build a car that's even smaller than the famous Peel P50. He then tests it out on the streets of London before putting his concept to the ultimate test of credibility in the fearsome `Dragons' Den'. Meanwhile, James May is testing the latest Bentley Continental GT Speed by taking it on a rally stage. Plus, Richard Hammond is at the test track to unleash the sensational new Pagani Huayra hypercar.
