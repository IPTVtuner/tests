Billy and Con's parents are beside themselves with worry and set off to England to find them. Meanwhile, the teens arrive in Ashdale only for their planned rendezvous with Fangoria Fangirl to go awry. While the police in the local area link them to a violent crime, the teens attempt to track down Fangoria Fangirl's address, but get more than they bargained for when they cross paths with an oddball teenager named Topher.
