It's a Glow Up first this week, as the MUAs go live on TikTok. Judged by social sensation and beauty C.E.O, P.Louise, the MUAs have the daunting task of jumping onto her platform for 15 mins each. They must showcase as many make-up tips and tricks as they can with just one product. The judges are joined by singer and songwriter Cat Burns, who credits TikTok as part of her rise to fame, after she dropped her number two single, `Go', on the platform.
