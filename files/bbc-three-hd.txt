Jill Douglas presents live coverage from day three of the Track Cycling World Championships in Ballerup, Denmark. A world-class field is guaranteed as the British team look to better their tally of nine medals from 2023. Some of the highlights of this evening's action include the men's kilometre time trial and individual pursuit and the women's omnium and sprint, the latter of which last year saw Welsh rider Emma Finucane delight the Glasgow crowd by claiming her first major gold medal.
