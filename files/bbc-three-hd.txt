Kwabena is an aspiring filmmaker working a dead-end job in recruitment. When he bumps into Amy, an old friend from film school who has just returned from three years in Nigeria, she offers to pass his script, Jamaica Road, to the development team at the production company where she works. But life isn't as simple as all that, and Kwabena may have to make some sacrifices in order to pursue his dream.
