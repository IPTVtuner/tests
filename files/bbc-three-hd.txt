Stacey Dooley is spending ten days living alongside the nuns of St Hilda's Priory in Whitby. Stacey's life is a whirlwind. She always throws herself into work and has struggled to prioritise her work-life balance. Although she is not a religious person, at the convent she is given the unique opportunity to try to connect to the rhythms of a deeper, slower, quieter and more meaningful way of being.
