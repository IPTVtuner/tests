RuPaul's search for the UK's Next Drag Race Superstar continues. This week, the queens' performance chops are tested to the max with the iconic Girl Group Challenge. The queens form two girl groups to write and record their own lyrics and perform their song in front of RuPaul and the panel of judges. This challenge sees the queens heading back to the 90s to create their very own club banger. It's a tuuuuuuuune!
