An English vicar and his wife visit an Australian artist and are drawn into the sexually liberated lifestyle of his unconventional household. Having visited to ask the painter to remove a picture from a current exhibition, the couple are at first astounded by the liberty he enjoys with his wife and three young models, but then their host's free-living ethos begins to exercise a hold on them.
