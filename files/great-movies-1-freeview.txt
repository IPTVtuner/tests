When Morgan Pierce quit his job at the coffee shop, Casey Cooper thought she had seen the last of her off-putting co-worker, but when Morgan starts calling Casey and watching her at work, she has a feeling something is wrong. Morgan's behaviour escalates and he begins to write letters and call her dozens of times a day. When Morgan crosses the line, she must find the strength inside herself to stop living in fear.
