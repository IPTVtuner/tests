Today, September 26
In a remote roadside diner in the Mojave desert, several locals including owner Bob Hanson, his son Jeep and pregnant waitress Charlie, begin to notice that something very unusual is going on. With no TV signal, all telecommunications failing, and an enormous dust cloud massing in the direction of LA, they begin to suspect a terrorist attack, but nothing can prepare them for the truth.
