For the right price, ex-Special Forces officer Frank Martin will take anything anywhere. He just has three rules: no changes to the plan; no real names; and no opening the package - until one package starts to move. Inside it is the beautiful Lai, and although Martin delivers her to the unscrupulous Darren `Wall Street' Bettencourt, his conscience soon gets the better of him and he decides to rescue Lai.
