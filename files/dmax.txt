The season began with terrible weather. The Maverick didn't even leave the harbour, The Cornelia Marie had to turn back, but Time Bandit managed to get out and had started to bring in the crab. As another storm is expected the men on Rollo are up at 4.30am to get pots into the water. Then the crane develops a leak of hydraulic fluid, and Cornelia Marie is limping back to harbour for repairs to the engine.
