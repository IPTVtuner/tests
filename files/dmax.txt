It's the third day of the 2005 Opilio crab season on the Bering Sea. Unseasonably warm weather and calm seas have contributed to record catches for the fleet. Captain Sig Hansen and the crew of the Northwestern landed on the crab early and worked flat out filling two of the boats three holds. On the Retriever, it's not all smooth sailing as a fire breaks out in the engine room and everyone's safety is put in jeopardy.
