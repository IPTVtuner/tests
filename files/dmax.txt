With the deaths of the Big Valley crew, this January Opilio crab season has been a rough one. On every boat, crewmembers are reaching their limit, but the pressure to catch a year's wages in the next 24 hours keeps them going. As the last hours of the season tick away, a new race begins: the race back to port. Offloading is done on a first-come-first-serve basis, so the captains compete for the best spot in line.
