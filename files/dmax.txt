It's the dead of winter in Dutch Harbor, Alaska, when the days are just six hours long. The forecast for crab fishing is cold and dangerous, and opilio crab season is about to begin. On a cold, rainy January day, 171 boats begin the long journey up to 450 miles northwest of Dutch Harbor. Shortly after leaving port, smoke and heat are discovered on the Lady Alaska.
