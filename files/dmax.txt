DMAX
Today, October 31
Freddy makes his eighth appearance while Jason clocks up his eleventh in Ronny Yu's horror meeting of the two icons of the slasher genre. Both of them are in Hell, but Freddy manipulates Jason to continue his slaughter of teens on Elm Street. However, Jason realises he's being used and, egged on by the surviving teenagers, the two meet for one final battle royal.
