Keith Floyd visits the West coast of Ireland where he tastes Milleens farmhouse cheese, and is shown how to make a real Irish Stew. Keith then makes spiced beef with colcannon with old friend Billy Mackesy, and rounds off his stay with a visit to a pottery where he makes hollandaise sauce and attempts to throw a pot.
