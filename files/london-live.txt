Set in 1968, an American student enters the lives of Parisians Theo and his sister Isabelle. The three share a love of the movies but soon their relationship is one of sexual entanglement. The film's plot is counter-pointed with extracts from classic films that almost act as a Greek chorus on their relationships, while the trio's reality is affected by the growing unrest on the streets.
