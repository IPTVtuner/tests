London Live
Today, November 07
Following in the footsteps of some of Britain's literary greats, Si and Dave take a pub tour of Oxford to visit the spot where C S Lewis and J R R Tolkien drank pints together. They also drop into one of the city's oldest inns - a favourite haunt of `Inspector Morse' creator, Colin Dexter. Si visits Brasenose College for a taste of one of their ancient rituals - Brasenose Ale.
