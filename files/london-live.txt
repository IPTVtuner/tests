Kate and her sheepdog Teg explore Carmarthenshire. In the Cothi Valley, Kate herds and milks goats, and in Capel Iwan, she tries her hand at trotting. Then in Cwm Elfed, they meet an Englishman keeping the Welsh weaving tradition alive, and near Carmarthen, they see how beavers are transforming a Welsh farm. Finally in Llansteffan, they take to the water, rowing across the Towy estuary to reach the end of their journey.
