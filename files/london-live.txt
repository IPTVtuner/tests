Follow three teenage boys all on the cusp of adulthood and dealing with the pressures of growing up. Craig doesn't want to leave home but his mum has lost her job and cannot keep the house. Wes is determined to be part of his son's life, so finding work is a priority in a city where jobs are scarce. Frankie is a changed person now and has a plan, but in a recession just getting a chance is hard enough.
