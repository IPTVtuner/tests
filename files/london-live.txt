Today, November 30
A chimney boy is sent up the chimneys of a mansion by his cruel master Grimes. Grimes then sets about stealing the silver but, when he's caught, blames it on Tom. Fleeing, the lad falls into the river and is sucked down but finds he can breathe and talk to the fish. Wanting to return to the real world, he searches for the other water babies to find the secret but first he must face a shark that has captured them.
