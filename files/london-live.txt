In the aftermath of the trial, and with Coates banished from town, it seems that nothing can hold back Annie and Johnny's growing relationship. The new quarry is a success for Jericho but, when a mineshaft collapses, Johnny is left trapped and in danger. Charles is forced to put his feelings aside in order to help him but when he too becomes trapped, the only man with the expertise to help is Coates, leaving the future of Johnny, Charles and the viaduct in his hands.
