Si and Dave's historic pub tour takes them to Glasgow where they explore the city's shipbuilding history. Meeting former shipyard workers, they discover what pub life was like when the yard's whistles blew. Si tries his hand at welding in a shipyard, and the Bikers celebrate the city's illustrious past with some cocktail making in a bar supposedly styled on the Clydebuilt ship, The Queen Mary.
