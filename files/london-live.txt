Si and Dave take a Manchester pub crawl to uncover historic boozers once at the heart of the city's industrial revolution. Starting in Middleton, they discover politics, protest and plotting were rife in one of the pub's back rooms during the early 1800's. They visit a local brewery to discover when and why beer became popular in Britain and they join a knitting group to find out why their Salford local is so important to the community.
