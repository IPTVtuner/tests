Kate visits Newport Pembrokeshire and meets the last master thatcher based in Wales. She helps with the harvesting of water reeds, an invasive, thick grass-like plant now used on 80% of thatched roofs in the UK. She then travels to Merthyr Mawr to learn that protected, historical buildings are thatched with heritage wheat straw, creating the classic `poured on custard' effect. In Pendine Sands, Kate joins a cross-country hunt adapted for modern times.
