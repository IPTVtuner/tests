Johnny is now the prime suspect for the murder of Red Killeen. Charles has washed his hands of Johnny, in spite of a desperate plea from Annie, and Coates is charged with delivering justice.

At a hearing in the Capsticks' tavern, the evidence against Johnny grows and, as anger builds, he risks facing a terrifying fate.
