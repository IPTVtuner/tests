Ray is off to the Pembrokeshire coast to visit the uninhabited island of Skomer. Because of the absence of mammal predators, this is a haven for thousands of seabirds, including razorbills, guillemots and over 6,000 pairs of puffins. He watches as they fly back and forth with mouthfuls of sand eels to feed their young. Later on, Ray ventures inland to explore the beautiful red campion-covered slopes.
