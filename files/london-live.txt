Ray heads to North Uist in the Outer Hebrides to explore Loch Maddy, the island's largest sea loch. Red deer, otters and common seals share its shores with just 2,000 human inhabitants along with diving and wading birds like the beautiful red-throated diver and magnificent sea eagle. Ray also goes scuba diving and explores the magical underworld beneath the loch's surface.
