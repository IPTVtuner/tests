London Live
Today, November 11
The idiosyncrasies and misfortunes of the lives of the townspeople of Cranford are played out. With the arrival of new residents the women are sparkling with anticipation. Centring on Matty Jenkyns and her older, stricter sister Deborah, we share in their excitement as a new house guest and neighbours arrive. When Jem, the local carpenter, falls from a tree, all eyes are on the new doctor and his untested modern methods.
