Si and Dave take a trip back in time in Cornwall where they discover pubs that were at the centre of an illegal industry in the late 1700's - smuggling! Starting in the tiny fishing village of Polperro they discover a smugglers tunnel and a landlord with criminal connections. Heading inland to Bodmin Moor the Hairy Bikers visit the famous Jamaica Inn where they discover how to make the tipple of the time - rum shrub.
