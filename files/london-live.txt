A young playwright, Richard Collier, is approached by an elderly woman on the occasion of his first triumph in 1972 and leaves him with a watch that contains a picture of a ravishing young woman. Eight years later, he visits the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island and comes upon a photograph of the same woman, whom he discovers was an actress who made an appearance at the hotel in 1912.
