Paul Murton continues his island odyssey, exploring the remote and fascinating places which scatter our coastline, and meeting the people who call these islands home. On this Grand Tour, Paul is exploring a cluster of islands in the Outer Hebrides. Lying just off the North Uist coast is princely Berneray, where his journey begins. From there he heads south to capture the colours of Grimsay, and then weaves through the marram grass of Kirkibost, to end on the deserted whisky island of Pabbay.
