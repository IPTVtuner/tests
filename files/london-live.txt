London Live
Today, November 18
Dave takes Si on a pub tour of his Lake District home patch, following in the footsteps of the poets, Wordsworth and Coleridge. On the way they sample negus - a wine-based drink from the late 1800's - and battle it out in a traditional pub competition to find out who is `The Biggest Liar'.
