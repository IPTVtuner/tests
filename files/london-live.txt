The Hairy Bikers pub tour takes them to Edinburgh, where they delve into the evil doings of Burke and Hare. On the way they discover dark histories in pubs that witnessed murder, crime and gruesome punishments in the 1800s and hear of a ghost who visits one of the city's oldest bars. They also meet a pub folk singer who keeps the city's historic tales alive in his songs.
