A routine flight from London Heathrow Airport to Belfast ended in tragedy when British Midland Flight 92 crashed on a highway embankment near the town of Kegworth on 8th January 1989. Due to an engine failure, the crew should have made an emergency landing. Unfortunately, the pilots misidentified which engine was faulty and switched off the wrong one, causing a catastrophic crash near the M1 motorway. The survivors give first-hand accounts of what the terrible crash was like.
