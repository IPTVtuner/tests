Ray Mears presents a new series of the documentary programme in which he explores Britain's most beautiful habitats and celebrates our wildlife. In this episode, Ray heads to the Caledonian pine forests of the Scottish heartlands. These ancient forests once spread across thousands of kilometres of the Highlands, but today only a few remnants remain. They are home to rare species including the capercaillie.
