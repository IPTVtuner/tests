Claustrophobic black comedy about a couple living in isolation on an island off the Northumbrian coast who are disturbed by two wounded criminals on the run. A retired businessman and his French wife live a reclusive existence in a castle on a small island, but the appearance of their two guests not only gives them cause for alarm, but also highlights the cracks in their own relationship.
