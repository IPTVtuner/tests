Johnnie Cousin is an up-and-coming jazz drummer who wants to start his own band, but he needs a singer. He attempts to court Delia, a famous retired singer, but to no avail. When it becomes clear to him that Delia won't play with him, Johnnie tries to convince Delia's husband Aurelius that Delia is cheating on him. His attempts to end their marriage may cost Johnnie his own. Many jazz greats of the 1960s perform in this update of Othello.
