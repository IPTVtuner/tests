London Live
Today, November 14
Si and Dave's historic pub tour takes them to London where they discover inns that witnessed The Great Fire and pubs that watered the workers during the massive 50 year rebuild of the city. The Hairy Bikers start at a pub on the banks of the Thames where Samuel Pepys watched the fire sweep through the city. They also meet modern day mud larkers who've uncovered fascinating finds in the muddy banks of the Thames - many of them linked to pub life in 1666.
