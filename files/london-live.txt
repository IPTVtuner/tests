Brett Aimsley is a high-class smooth operator who always gets what he wants. Clifford Southey, on the other hand, is a lowly bounder trying his best to imitate and one-up Aimsley.

But, hoping to capitalise on his fancy rival's misfortune, Southey follows shortly thereafter, and the two find themselves on opposite sides of a business deal involving a hotel.
