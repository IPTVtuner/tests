Dion O'Banion led the Northside Gang in Chicago during the early years of prohibition. A man of contradictions - he was a devoted husband, a flower shop owner and part-time crooner but he was also a ruthless mobster and bootlegger directly responsible for a string of murders. He was the iconic Irish mobster that would become the model for James Cagney & Warner Brothers studios when they created their cinematic gangsters.
