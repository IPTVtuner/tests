Today, November 19
Dr Chris and Dr Xand reveal how your skull protects your brain, and they're thrown in at the deep end when they find themselves running the reception desk of a busy GP surgery for Operation Takeover. Find out how to deal with a severe allergic reaction in First Aid and we catch up with Ouch patients Millie and Bolu. Meanwhile over in Accident and Emergency, one patient has twisted their leg falling as a trampoline park, and another has diamonds stuck up his nose.
