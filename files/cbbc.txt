Archie is 10 years old and as well as planting, growing and harvesting vegetables, he loves looking after his chickens. Archie sells his home grown veg and eggs locally and uses the profits to buy food for his local food bank. He's taken his enterprise as far as he can and desperately needs a farm den so he can increase his productivity.
