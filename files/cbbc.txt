Steve combs the Venezuelan wetlands looking for the biggest snake in the world, the mighty Green Anaconda, capable of growing to over six metres in length. Then, Steve heads beneath the rainforest and into a dark cave infested with vampire bats. He searches within for a true toxic terror, the Scolopendra, a giant centipede armed with a powerful venomous bite.
