After a fire at Burnywood, four young people and their care worker Dennis arrive at the Dumping Ground. Carmen recognises Tyler, a young joker, and Johnny takes a shine to Lizanne. Rick is protective of Kitty, a shy girl that Tracy wants to help out of her shell, despite a warning about her unpredictable behaviour. When a fire breaks out in the attic, Tracy and Gus set out to find out who is the fire-starter.
