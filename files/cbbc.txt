Cam, Tyler and Aaron explore the wonders of the wetlands and meet the wildlife heroes working hard to help protect its animal inhabitants. It's an early start for Tyler as he heads to Devon hoping to bump into a beaver and discover why this furry eco engineer is having a huge impact on the land and its wildlife. Cam is on the outskirts of Manchester to lend a hand restoring a wetland habitat that is helping combat climate change, all thanks to a super-plant called sphagnum moss.
