Two nine-year-old old boys live every child's Christmas dream of flying with The Snowman as they recreate the magical story on London's West End stage. With less than four weeks to get to grips with the demanding role, we follow Phoenix and Teddy every step of the way, from the first auditions, to the high-pressure rehearsals, and finally, to the glittering first night.
