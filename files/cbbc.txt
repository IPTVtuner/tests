Today, March 15
MAISIE is in the office being told off by DOREEN for tampering with Jimi's game. She needs to integrate and make more of an effort with the kids in the house. At breakfast, JIMI taunts Maisie by eating her waffles. In the secret den, FRANKIE is telling OSCAR off for writing on his secret board. Only HE is allowed to write on the board. SHANICE radios in that the den door's been left open, and IZZY is approaching.
