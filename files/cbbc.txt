The YP want a new computer but Mike will not get one until they prove they can look after their things. So Tracy sets an `egg-sitting' challenge and the YP team up in pairs to look after an egg but eventually every egg gets smashed. Johnny and Elektra sell the others new eggs they have bought but Tracy has marked the eggs so she knows that they swapped them. Elsewhere, Sapphire tells Harry that she is not his mum.
