It's Charlie's mum's birthday and she's especially pleased with the special vase that dad has bought her as a present, displaying it proudly in the B & B lounge - until Charlie gets his hands on it that is. Meanwhile, Charlie's older sister Hannah is annoyed by her mum and dad's choice of babysitter.
