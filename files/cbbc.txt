The Jurassic was home to the most vicious and violent predators the world has ever seen. To survive, herbivores had to fight back! Steve Backshall goes on a mission to track down the deadliest of all dinosaur defenders. He'll meet the armoured tank that is Nodosaurus, he'll test whether an Iguanodon really has what it takes to beat a T-rex, and thanks to some mega-engineering he'll unleash an Ankylosaurus tail-swinging robot that goes on the rampage and then some!
