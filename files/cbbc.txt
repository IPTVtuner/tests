Today, November 11
Dr Chris and Dr Xand turn back the clock and look at what medicine was like in the First World War. They meet a paralympian runner who swaps her awesome blade for a WW1 leather leg and they look at the little critters that infested the trenches. Then they set up a massive experiment to demonstrate how soldiers' bodies had to cope with the pressures exerted from huge explosions.
