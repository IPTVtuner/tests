Male zebra Stripy McButtface has a problem with his feet - his overgrown hooves mean he can't run to herd his females. The only solution is to allow the vets to trim his hooves but he hates having his feet checked. Meanwhile, as his herd of females start looking elsewhere for a male to chase them around, the zoo's vets are out on their rounds conducting foot checks on all of the other animals - penguins, ducks, elephants and giraffes.
