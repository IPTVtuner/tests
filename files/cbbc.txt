Ten-year-old Izzy is planning a candy-coloured deliciously sweet extravaganza as a treat for her mum after a terrible year which saw her mum diagnosed with cancer. The candyland-themed wedding includes the Candyland Express with edible train tickets, a cake-delivering gumball machine and a facing splatting custard challenge.
