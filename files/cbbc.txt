Lance is a ping pong whizz, he always aces the annual Pottsfield Ping Pong competition. This year Danny's determined to teach him a thing or two and has stayed up all night watching online tutorials. Now he can't keep his eyes open long enough to play! Lance smells victory, Mick smells trouble. Mick is determined to find Danny somewhere to get a nap. However, with Joy on the prowl and Lance making things difficult it looks like Danny may never lift that trophy!
