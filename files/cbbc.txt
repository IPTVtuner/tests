The army is called in to help with some major renovations around the zoo. Jurgen the gorilla, self-appointed leader, immediately assumes the extra muscle power is to help build his new luxury gymnasium, complete with hot tub and juice bar. But miniature megalomaniac monkey, Brutus, has other plans for the army - he wants their help to build his 'Death-ray of World Domination' - but will either of their demands be met?
