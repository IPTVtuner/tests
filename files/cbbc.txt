This film revisits three remarkable Syrian refugee children - Ahmed, Ola and Ali - whose lives in Za'atari refugee camp were featured in the multi-award winning 2015 documentary, My Life: The Boy on the Bicycle. After seven years of conflict in Syria, there are now five million Syrian refugees scattered across the world and this film explores some of the longer-term legacies of war - how it can shape the lives of the children who managed to get away, forever.
