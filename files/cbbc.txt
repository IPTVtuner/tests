Inventor extraordinaire Mrs Armitage and faithful dog Breakspear love adventurous hobbies such as skydiving, until an accident dents Mrs Armitage's confidence. Recovered, she plans a short cycling trip, but keeps putting it off, adapting her bike with horns, a tool kit, and even a sail! The 'land yacht' eventually launches, but a further accident leaves Mrs Armitage doubly nervous.
