Today, November 30
Join the doctors for a special episode as they revisit with Ouchers from across the last seven series to find out how they are doing now. We revisit Matthew, who had a cochlear implant enabling him to hear four years ago, as well as Ouch Patients Ruby and Bolu, to see how their leukemia and sickle cell anemia treatments are going. We find out if Declan made it back to diving competitions after breaking his leg a year ago and discover how much taller David has grown thanks to his ilizarov frame.
