Horrible Histories favourite, Death of `Stupid Deaths' fame presents his very own show crammed full of spooky highlights. We join him at home and get a good look around as he reveals his creepiest moments. Then later on, Death himself is joined by some rather creepy friends to sing about his favourite scary things.
