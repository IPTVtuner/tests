Best friends Bella and Chloe plan a wedding of theatrical proportions as they put on a Shakespeare-inspired wedding. Mum and Dad have to perform some of Shakespeare's most famous works for their wedding guests, while dodging rotten veg if their performance isn't up to scratch. With thunderous transport, outrageous acting and royal guests, this wedding is a full-on Shakespearean drama.
