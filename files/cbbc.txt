Fearless Pete Parsnip takes on some pasta bats, and star bar sets off on another trip to the moon. Mr and Mrs Strawberry get ready for a romantic night in front of the telly, the toast soldiers attempt to ambush an unsuspecting egg, and a pear and an apple amuse the judges with their strongman talent show act.
