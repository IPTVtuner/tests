Alex is back from injury but in a despondent mood during training. Coach Byrne privately speculates that it's to do with the letter he got from his dad. Alex and Mason clash on the pitch, but Coach Byrne only punishes Mason, who fumes at the injustice. Coach Byrne then invites Alex to practise taking penalties, convincing him to open up to him by saving one of them.
