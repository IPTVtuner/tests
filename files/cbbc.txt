Rattus has enlisted the help of Richie - the Horrible Histories songwriter - to help him present a special song-filled show by making every one of Rattus' bits a song too! Rattus has even brought a triangle along with him to add some musical flair. Along the way, we hear a gross song about boils, a tune about warring brothers, a fabulous footy tune, Queen Victoria take you for a break by the ocean, and why early police had a 'hard cops' life'.
