Sharon's boss, Mrs Harris, has come to the leisure centre to make sure that things are running smoothly. She thinks she can run it better herself and so fires a distraught Sharon. However, it is not as easy as it looks, and Danny and Mick make sure Mrs Harris' boss, Dame Frost, fires her and brings Sharon back to get things back under control.
