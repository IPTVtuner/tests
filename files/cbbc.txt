Ricky finds a shop dummy and when he puts a curly wig on it, he decides it looks a bit like his mate Ella. Following a weird power surge in the flat the mannequin seems to come alive, but not everyone can see it. Unperturbed Ricky makes a brainbox memory keeper, a satchel inspired by Peter Blake and a magic wallet and then decides to take the dummy to the recycling centre and to make some epic art from scrapyard trash?
