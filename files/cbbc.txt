Set on a remote rural farm, Shaun's flock lives a peaceful life under the watchful eye of their sheepdog Bitzer. A bored Shaun dresses up as the Farmer to entertain the flock. Realising he now has the power to boss Bitzer around, Shaun takes the opportunity to throw a party for the flock, and all goes to plan until Bitzer puts two and two together. Then, Shaun encounters the real Farmer.
