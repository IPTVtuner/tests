Pop sensation Zoe Now is coming to officially open Pottsfield leisure centre's new reception. Joy tasks Danny and Mick with looking after the star guest but get in a tangle with the opening ribbon. Zoe Now arrives but Danny's attempts at hospitality leave her without a voice, minutes before she's due to sing. With the aid of a cap and wig from lost property, lots of smoke and a backing track, Danny reckons nobody will spot the difference if he takes her place.
