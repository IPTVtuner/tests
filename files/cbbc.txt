Tala and Flynn have three things in common - they are both ten, love their hamsters and both have a dad in prison. Their fathers were sent to prison when they were very young and won't be released until Tala and Flynn are teenagers. Tala writes a prison blog about what life is like since dad was taken away. Flynn makes video diaries of family days out to show dad when he comes home.
