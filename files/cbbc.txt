Doug wants to be in the school show, so he asks Waffle to help him with his act. They practice ventriloquism in the kitchen together. Doug pretends to speak Waffle's voice but Waffle doesn't really understand what to do, so Doug asks Simon for advice. Simon suggests Doug does something for the school show that he's good at already. Simon demonstrates what he's good at by singing Waffle Doggy.
