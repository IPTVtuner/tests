Dr Chris challenges Dr Xand to beat Dougie the dog in a race, showing you how your shoulders work. The doctors catch up with our Ouch Babies in their first weeks of life, and there is a face-twisting trick in Mindbenders. We drop in on Ouch Patients Amelia and Finn, and Dr Xand meets triple jumper Naomi Ogbeta in Brilliant Bodies. Meanwhile, over in the Emergency Department Abu Bakr has a broken nose and Georgina has a bent toe.
