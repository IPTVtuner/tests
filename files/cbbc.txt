A massive Beanostalk sprouts up in Beanotown, taking all the gang's Christmas stuff, and Gnasher, up beyond the clouds to a land of giants! Dennis and the Gang bravely climb up to Ginormotown, determined to find Gnasher and bring Christmas back home. On their journey they find themselves giving away all their christmas goodies, showing the Ginormotowners, and themselves what the spirit of Christmas is really about!
