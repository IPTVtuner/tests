Rehearsal is under way for a very special holiday performance of `The Nutcracker'. Piper feels invisible after James and the original A-Troupe return to TNS and wishes she never came to the studio in the first place. Her wish is granted when Giselle, as a fairy, appears and guides her through a Piper-less studio. It's a very different TNS where A-Troupers from past and present are almost unrecognisable.
