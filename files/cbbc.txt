Jessie Cave and judges Sadie Clayton and Ricky Martin search for Britain's Best Young Artist. Today, three of our 27 young artists enter the art studio to create a fantastical surreal collage that must include themselves. For their inspiration day, the artists head to Blackpool, where Ricky teaches them a cool collage technique at the top of the tower, before they head to the theme park to take photos for their final masterpiece.
