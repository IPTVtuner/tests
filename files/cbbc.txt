It's the cartoon round, and the three artists must create their own original cartoon that perfectly tells a story. To get their creativity flowing, Ricky takes them to meet two cartoon artists at a legendary comic, who teach them how to create perfect storyboards that tell a story. They then return to the art studio to create their artworks in the given time.
