Cam, Tyler and Aaron venture out and about to meet the wildlife heroes making a difference with some of Britain's threatened woodland animals. In the Scottish Highlands, Cam helps a conservation project working to protect and increase numbers of the rare red squirrel. To help him search for one of our smallest and most misunderstood mammals, Cam must team up with a 'bat detective' to discover some of the latest technology being used to monitor the common pipistrelle bat.
