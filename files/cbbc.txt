Whilst waiting to pick up Penfold's vacationing cousin from New Zealand, Pinfold, at the airport, Danger Mouse receives orders to stop Burt Badboy's spree of mass statue defacement. When Penfold pops to the toilet moments before Pinfold arrives, a distracted DM mistakenly jets off with Penfold's cousin in tow, leaving Penfold stranded at the airport.
