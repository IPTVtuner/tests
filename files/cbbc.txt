Today, November 28
There's a tug of war in today's lab as the doctors show the incredible strength of your ligaments. Dr Xand meets a dad and his son making bionic hands in their living room, we catch up with Ouch Patients Amelia and Finn, and our Ouch babies, for the last time. And, can you spot the disappearing head in Mindbenders? Meanwhile, over in the Emergency Department Thomas has had a nasty fall from a swing and Roman has cut his chin playing tag.
