Hoping to re-unite the family, Lily has coached her dad Steve in all things Poppy and Rosie in readiness for his first meeting with them but, having no memory of their dad, Poppy and Rosie run out crying. Convinced Steve would do better without official interference, Carmen and Tee help Lily plot a second meeting between Lily and her sisters without telling anyone her dad will be there too.
