Leia is the host of a very unpopular board game-themed videocast. She invites Oswaldo to be her assistant during one of her shows, but he manages to trip all over himself and create a mess of glue and cardboard in a matter of seconds. The next day, the video goes viral, and Oswaldo is internet famous for about three minutes. It's enough to get him drunk on success.
