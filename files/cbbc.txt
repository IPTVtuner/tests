Lou is hosting a `who dun it' evening. She has written a play in which `Mr Brown' is kidnapped and the audience have to guess what happened. Meanwhile, Jas is set to visit Sid - they haven't seen each other all term but talk all the time via telepathy. However, Lily and Martha believe Sid has moved on and that Jas's telepathy is nonsense.
