Operation Ouch! celebrates its tenth birthday with a party like no other. Dr Chris is in charge of decorations, Dr Ronx has sorted the cake, Mr Grumbles is on the decks with some top tunes, and Dr Xand has sent out all the invites - or has he?! In this special episode, the doctors celebrate a decade of gross alerts, catch up with some awesome Ouchers, and fail to stop mini Xand from eating the cake before it's time. Today's British Sign Language sign is 'Happy Birthday!'
