Grim HQ struggles through the sky above the Atlantic Ocean, fighting against the powerful winds of a hurricane. One Grimbot falls overboard before the ship crash-lands at Go Jet Academy. Needing another ship to rescue the missing Grimbot, Grandmaster Glitch steals Jetpad. The Go Jetters give chase in the Grimbler, heading right into the eye of the storm.
