Lars and Foz are in the Wolong Nature Reserve in China, taking care of the 2,000 pandas that live in the wild there. Grim HQ has also landed in the Wolong reserve, having been through a monsoon. The rain has washed Grandmaster Glitch's ship sparkling clean. Glitch is grumpy - he likes his Grim HQ to be dirty and, well, grim! He tries to use his mud splatterer to make Grim HQ dirty again, but he can't get high enough to reach the top of the ship.
