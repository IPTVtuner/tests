It's the morning of Evie's first day at school and the Brooklyn-Bells are on schedule. But Waffle isn't happy. He's expecting his usual morning walkies. Doug tells Waffle that Gramps will be walking him today, he'll be coming to the house later. Waffle is insistent, he wants to walk to school with the rest of the family.
