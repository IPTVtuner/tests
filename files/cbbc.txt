Charlie and his family run a bed and breakfast by the sea. Charlie and his pals try to help a Punch and Judy puppeteer 'improve' his act - and may just be about to ruin his life in the process. Meanwhile, Mum is trying to get down with the kids - much to Hannah's horror and Louis wants a friend to stay over.
