As Buddy and Conker decorate their kitchen den for Christmas, they get a call from Meesha Garbett - a two-time World Champion street dancer. Meesha needs Buddy's help with a dessert that she can make for her family this Christmas, and she will give him a street dance lesson in return! Buddy knows exactly the right thing to make; a rocky road filled with all the favourite biscuits, fruit and nuts around at this time of year, all broken up into gorgeous molten chocolate.
