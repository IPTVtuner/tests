St. Hugh of Lincoln Primary School is in Manchester, many of their pupils have specific needs and would benefit from a space of their own. But the school has no extra space! To solve this they had the clever idea of using an old double decker bus but that was as far as they got. That's where The Dengineers come in! With our top team and expert designer we are the perfect people to convert the bus and give the deserving pupils their much needed breakout space!
