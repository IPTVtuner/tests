The Lemmings have set up a long line of dominos in the cabin that ends with several giant ice blocks and a rocket outside. Weary of not finding the peace and calm he loves so dearly, Grizzy sabotages the game. The rocket hits an ice block and blows up the cabin. Grizzy gets his hands on a machine that can sculpt ice. The bear dreams of an igloo, but the Lemmings have other projects.
