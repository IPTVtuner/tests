Grandmaster Glitch is visiting London and spots the perfect souvenir at a riverside stall - a majestic hat that was clearly made for a Grandmaster! But when he finds he has no money, he decides to raise some by working as a tour guide on the River Thames. The Go Jetters are also visiting London while Lars helps to fix his favourite his bridge - Tower Bridge. Ubercorn explains that this amazing bridge can be raised to allow tall river traffic to pass safely beneath.
