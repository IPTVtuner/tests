Convinced Fleur has a new boyfriend, Eleesha has dragged Eli and Owen to lurk behind the bins outside Fleur's house to catch her in the act. Meanwhile, Polly has said she'll help Eleesha with the school fashion show. It might be fun, but really it's to get her nagging mum off her back. But then Evan tells Polly school and home are doing his head in and he's heading out for a while to go night fishing, like he used to with his granddad, does she want to come?
