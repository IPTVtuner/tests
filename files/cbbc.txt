The farmer has set up a stall by the side of the road, selling produce from the garden. He leaves Bitzer in charge for the day, but lazy Bitzer soon gets bored and gives Shaun the job while he puts his feet up by the pool. Shaun proves to be a much better salesman than Bitzer, and the flock are only too happy to get stuck in, selling pretty much all the farmer's worldly possessions.
