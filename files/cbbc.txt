Step inside the magical world of Quentin Blake's Box of Treasures as we learn to become illustrators in this fun art and literacy Live Lesson. Inspired by the BBC animated films and Quentin Blake's original illustrations, we learn how to draw our very own Zagazoo, one of his most beloved characters, who transforms into different animals to represent the stages of growing up.
