Danny and Mick's dad Clive has turned up with his latest in a long line of `sure-fire' money making schemes: washing customers' cars in the car park while they use the leisure centre. The boys are happy to help and are soon scrubbing away, but when Joy finds out and demands a free wash, the boys clean her beloved old banger so hard it falls to bits. Don't worry lads, Clive knows how to fix this, or at least replace one problem with a much bigger problem.
