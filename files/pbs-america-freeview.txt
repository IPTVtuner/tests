America's postwar prosperity continues and, in jazz, young talents arise to take the music in new directions. In 1956, the first year Elvis tops the charts, Duke Ellington has his best-selling record ever. New artists emerge, most prominently Sonny Rollins, Sarah Vaughan and Miles Davis. Davis comes to exemplify the very essence of cool but, as the 1960s arrive, two freewheeling saxophonists, John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman, take jazz into uncharted terrain.
