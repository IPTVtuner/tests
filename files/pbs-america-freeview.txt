John Lewis and the supremely elegant Modern Jazz Quartet refine bebop's balance between improvisation and composition. However, few people are listening to bebop. California musicians create the mellow sound of cool jazz, and Dave Brubeck mixes jazz with classical music to produce the first million-selling jazz LP, Time Out. Then Miles Davis is poised to lead jazz in a new direction.
