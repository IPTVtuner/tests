Egyptologist Dr Joann Fletcher discovers what life was really like for ordinary Egyptians 3,500 years ago, during the height of the incredible civilisation of ancient Egypt. Joann explores how people lived during this time, from the tightly packed houses and villages of the common people, to the clothes they wore and the food they ate.
