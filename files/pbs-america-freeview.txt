In the Pacific, Americans are fighting on the island of Okinawa, gateway to Japan. Meanwhile, in Europe, allied forces rapidly push across Germany from the East and West, and discover the true horrors of the Nazi's industrialized barbarism, at Buchenwald, Dachau, Mauthausen and hundreds of other concentration camps. Finally, on May 8th, with their country in ruins and their Fuehrer dead by his own hand, the Germans surrender.
