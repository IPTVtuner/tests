In every war there are POWs and MIAs, often seen as booty, hostages or ballast by governments. After WWII, several hundred thousand Germans, French, Dutch, Belgians, Poles, Brits and others were whisked off to the Soviet Union. Originally captives of the Germans, or forced labourers for the Nazi Reich. Though many were even Allies of Stalin, they ended up going from one captivity to the next as the Soviets approached.
