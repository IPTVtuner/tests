In the late fall of 1944 American soldiers suffer terrible losses when they are ordered into the forbidding and fiercely defended terrain of the Hurtgen Forest and the Vosges Mountains. In the Central Pacific, to the delight of audiences back home, General MacArthur returns to the island of Leyte, but months of bloody fighting lie ahead before the Philippine Islands - and the people imprisoned on them - can be liberated.
