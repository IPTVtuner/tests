Dan Snow takes us on a journey around Hadrian's vast empire. As he does so, he uncovers the genius and the darker side of the man: peace-maker, frontier-builder, star-crossed lover, architect, and ruthless oppressor of the Jews. However, Dan concludes, Hadrian was one of the greatest Roman Emperors.
