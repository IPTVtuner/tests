Paul crosses the country from one coast to the the other, taking in the remote lighthouse at Tarbat Ness and the iconic castle of Eilean Donan. Travelling off the beaten track, Paul encounters the bottlenose dolphins that live in the Cromarty firth and travels by horseback through Glen Afric, one of Scotland's most spectacular locations.
