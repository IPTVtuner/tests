Episode Two explores a critical time in Irish history - the move from paganism to Christianity. Medieval records don't give much information on the lives of ordinary people, but now DNA and other scientific techniques are opening fascinating windows into the past. Evidence from burial sites in Ireland show that ancient pre-Christian beliefs continued long into the Christian era. And now, a shocking discovery in County Roscommon suggests that some feared the rise of undead creatures.
