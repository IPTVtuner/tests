The Zeppelin, the biggest flying machine ever to have existed, delivered a deadly payload straight to the heart of a nation and, for a time, there was nothing the British could do to stop them. This new kind of terror campaign rewrote the rules of war. Engineer Dr Hugh Hunt investigates the technical challenges that each side had to overcome in their war in the air.
