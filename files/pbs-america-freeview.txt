Dr Nina Ramirez explores the fall-out of the longest and bloodiest divorce in history, when little England dared to take on the superpower France. England, wracked by plague and revolt, loses the upper hand until Henry V, determined to prove his right to be king, turns the tide at the battle of Agincourt.
