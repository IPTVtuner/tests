This episode explores how DNA research is revealing the truth about Ireland's early inhabitants. Some 10,000 years ago dark-skinned, blue-eyed people roamed our forests. Thousands of years later, they were replaced by a new wave of settlers that introduced a dynamic new technology - farming. Now, Dr Lara Cassidy of Trinity College Dublin has uncovered a shocking secret about a man who was buried at the centre of Newgrange, our most sacred ancient monument.
