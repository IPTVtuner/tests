Heinrich Himmler, in his bid to establish himself as Hitler's successor, orders his deputy Reinhard Heydrich to set in motion a terrifying programme of ethnic cleansing. In doing so, Heydrich establishes himself as chief architect of the Holocaust, masterminding the mass murder of millions of Jews. However, after he skilfully crushes Czech resistance in Prague his own meteoric rise makes him a target both in and outside Hitler's circle of evil.
