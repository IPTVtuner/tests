Today, November 19
In October 1917, the Bolsheviks rose up, swept the tsar from power and communism was born. Lucy explores the myths and fibs that swirl around the dramatic events of 1917. She finds it was really a group of women workers who kick-started the Russian Revolution in February 1917. At the time, the Bolsheviks tried to stop it, and Lenin, the radical leader of the Bolsheviks, wasn't even in the country.
