Historian Peter Barton concludes his history of the Battle in the final months of the campaign. He shows how a remarkable German tactical revolution begun in the Summer of 1916 continued throughout this period to frustrate the allied advance. This would have profound implications, tragically extending the entire First World War far beyond allied expectations. Barton also presents a new narrative which argues that the Battle of the Somme ended not in the Winter of 1916 but in the Spring of 1917.
