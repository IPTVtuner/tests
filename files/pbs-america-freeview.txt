Dr Thomas Asbridge re-examines the medieval Crusades. Retracing the steps of the Crusaders from a small town in France to the magnificent cities of the Holy Land, Asbridge brings to life the human experience of the Crusades. He sheds new light on how it was that two of the world's great religions waged war in the name of God and why hundreds of thousands of Christians and Muslims answered the call to Crusade and Jihad.
