A wartime Spitfire is unearthed from an Irish bog, while divers explore sunken U-boats and merchant ships littering the seabed offshore. Dan Snow tells how, during World War II, Northern Ireland was thrust to the heart of the Battle of the Atlantic, and how excavations in Italy reveal just how Northern Irish troops took the fight to the battlegrounds of Europe.
