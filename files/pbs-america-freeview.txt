Cold War tensions are reflected in the broken rhythms and dissonant melodies of bebop and in the troubled life of bebop's biggest star, Charlie 'Bird' Parker. His improvisations and self-destructive, narcotics-plagued lifestyle are copied by other musicians. His longtime partner, Dizzy Gillespie, tries to popularise the new sound, however, young audiences are now swooning over pop singers like Frank Sinatra. Louis Armstrong forms the All Stars but encounters racism in New Orleans.
