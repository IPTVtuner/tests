The team visit Beamish in County Durham to explore how the railway companies soon recognised that there was money to be made in moving people, rather than just stone, coal and iron. The comfort of the early passenger wagons are put to the test on one of the earliest steam trains, and Ruth finds out how people were moving further than ever before.
