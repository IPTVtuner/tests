Dr Nina Ramirez explores the fall-out of the longest and bloodiest divorce in history, when little England dared to take on the superpower France. Edward III rips up the medieval rule book and crushes the flower of French knighthood at the Battle of Crecy with his low-born archers. His son, the Black Prince, conducts a campaign of terror, helping to bring France to her knees.
