By the late 1980s, the news in Northern Ireland is a daily list of the dead. But 14 bloody days in March 1988 mark a new level of harrowing savagery. When a car reverses at speed into an IRA funeral cortege, mourners are convinced it's another attack, a repeat of a grenade and gun strike by a lone loyalist that had killed three at an IRA funeral just days earlier. The car contains two British soldiers who are lynched and shot dead by a baying mob.
