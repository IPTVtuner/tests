In 2023, BBC 100 Women is highlighting women from across the world who have been working to help their communities tackle climate change and mitigate its effects. We will be broadcasting from the UN's COP28 in Dubai and from Nairobi, bringing together some of our grassroots pioneers to provide a space to share their thoughts and deeply personal experiences of living life right on the forefront of the climate crisis, amidst a growing sense of climate anxiety.
