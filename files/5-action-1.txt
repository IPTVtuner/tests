Set in Wyoming in the 1870s when gold is found, prospectors are eager to invade the Cheyenne's lands. To avoid a massacre, the Cheyenne are asked to sign a treaty agreeing to move south and instrumental in the negotiations is surveyor Josh Tanner, who has befriended Chief Broken Hand, his son Little Dog and his daughter Appearing Day. However, Little Dog is antagonistic to the move and challenges the cavalry to a fight.
