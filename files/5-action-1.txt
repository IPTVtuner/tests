A wagon train guard is wrongly accused and convicted of being party to a raid on the train and is sentenced to hang. His execution, however, is commuted to a term of imprisonment through the intervention by the local sheriff, but he is sprung from prison by a Yaqui Indian he once helped, and sets out to clear his name and bring the real culprit to book.
