Epic tale about the Boxer Rebellion in turn-of-the-20th-century China. When the German ambassador is murdered, all foreigners are ordered to leave, but some refuse, barricading themselves into the international compound to await rescue from a group of multinational troops, but one of them is secretly collaborating with the Chinese and, as the imperial forces gather strength, the prisoners resort to desperate measures.
