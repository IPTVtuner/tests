Bat Masterson takes over as the law in Dodge City when his brother is shot in the back. Egged on by girlfriend Pauline Howard, he stands against corrupt sheriff Jim Regan and soon brings his own justice against the bullies and criminals. However, as the climatic gunfight approaches, he realises that maybe Howard isn't the right girl for him and perhaps saloon owner Lily is.
