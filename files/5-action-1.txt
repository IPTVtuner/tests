The Eurocopter gets down and dirty in a lengthy manhunt, a vanload of villains lose control in a high speed pursuit and a drunk driver crushes his Corsa like it is a tin can. Elsewhere, a speed freak thinks he can outrun the law, there is aggravation and abuse on Derbyshire's mean streets and the interceptors facing off against an eight legged enemy.
