Ex-army doctor Jonathan Westgate arrives at the outpost of Laramie Junction and finds trouble. The town's trade is selling horses to the army, and while Joan Britton handles a few honestly purchased steeds, her rival, Stephen Cook is happy to rustle his ponies from the local Sioux. Westgate promises the local chief Red Cloud he'll put a stop to the illegal trading, but Cook frames him for the crime.
