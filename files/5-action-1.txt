Todd is an orphaned son of white settlers bought up by the Comanche. When his wife and children are killed by three brothers, he exacts appropriate revenge. Caught and charged with murder, he's sent by wagon train to face justice, but when the train is attacked by Apaches, he is the only male adult survivor and has to escort a rag-tag band of survivors to safety while the law set off in pursuit of their quarry.
