Belle Starr is the daughter of a Southern aristocrat. When the invading Yankees take over her land, she vows revenge and heads to Missouri where she marries Confederate outlaw Sam Starr, and joins him and his gang in harrying the occupying troops. In fact, the real Belle Starr was a simple outlaw who, with her Cherokee husband, used the opportunity of the confusion of war to line their own pockets.
