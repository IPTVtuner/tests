A Civil War veteran patiently tracks a vicious killer in order to claim the $5,000 reward on offer so he can buy a small farm and settle down. Along the way, he teams up with a mean ex-Confederate, a luckless old prospector, and an outlaw's beautiful daughter. After his capture, the killer sows seeds of discord among the bounty hunters.
