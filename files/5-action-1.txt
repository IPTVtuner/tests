Artorious Castus and his band of Sarmatian cavalry are about to be discharged from the Roman army, but have one final task to perform - they must rescue a Roman priest and his family before the land is overrun by Saxons. However, there is another danger lurking on the road to freedom - the Woads, British rebels who hate the Romans, but who are also threatened by the Saxons.
