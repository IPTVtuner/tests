A car thief is forced to steal 50 luxury vehicles in one night in order to save the life of his brother, who has fallen foul of a dangerous crime lord. Once the most successful car thief in California, he must reassemble his old gang to fulfil the almost impossible mission. His task is further hampered by a rival band of thieves and, of course, the local police.
