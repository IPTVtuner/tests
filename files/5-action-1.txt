Déjà vu is what unexpectedly guides agent Doug Carlin through an investigation into a crime. After an explosion in New Orleans, Doug is called to check and recover the evidence, but Carlin's enquiries uncover a connection between the bomb accelerant and the body of a local girl named Claire Kuchever. Things become even stranger when Doug hears his own voice on Claire's answering machine.
