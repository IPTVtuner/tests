The outwardly charming and intelligent psychopath Dr Lecter is in Florence, masquerading as a museum curator. A greedy cop discovers his true identity, and plans to hand him over to someone willing to pay, but things do not go to plan when female FBI agent Clarice Starling gets a call to help Lecter's only living victim - the hideously deformed Mason Verger.
