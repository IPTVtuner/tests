Wall Street banker Jack Campbell has it all - more cash than he can shake a stick at, oodles of power and, above all, his freedom. On Christmas Eve he challenges an armed robber, then on Christmas Day he wakes up to the life he would have had if he'd stayed with his college girlfriend - two noisy kids, a dead-end job selling tyres, and a people carrier instead of his Ferrari.
