Peppa has a new pen pal, a little donkey from France, named Delphine. Peppa receives letters from Delphine Donkey and speaks to her on the telephone. Although Peppa speaks English and Delphine speaks French, they discover that they love lots of the same things, especially jumping up and down in muddy puddles.
