Monica decides the best way to get over Richard is to keep herself busy. She develops a `jam plan', hoping the distraction of cooking will divert her attention. After making jars and jars of jam Monica decides she still wants to have a baby, so she begins searching for a sperm donor, and comes across Joey's file. Elsewhere, Phoebe is mistakenly stalked by a man who thinks she's Ursula, and Chandler receives dating advice.
