Ben heads back to the stunning Saharan landscape of Morocco, where he first met Karen, an extraordinary artist who had turned her back on urban life to live in the middle of the desert. Ben learned how Karen had transformed her arid plot of desert into a stunning artist's retreat. They trekked into the sand dunes, built bamboo shelters and embraced Karen's life in her local Berber village.
