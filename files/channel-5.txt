Ravenmaster Chris Skaife has hand-reared George, the first raven hatched at the Tower for more than 30 years. After a month living with Chris, it's time for young George to join the rest of the ravens. But not all the ravens welcome a new member, especially Poppy, and a spot of bird jealousy ensues.
