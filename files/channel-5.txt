A Zenist martial-arts expert is hired by a small-town bar to clean up the clientele and eject the trouble makers who plague the establishment. The bouncer soon encounters the local crime boss, and the scene is set for a showdown between the good and the bad of the town. Ry Cooder performs the soundtrack.
