This documentary takes viewers beyond the lobby to discover the stories of the UK's first ever luxury hotel. This bastion of British hospitality has been welcoming guests for 130 years. No request is too big and no detail too small - we learn some of the tricks of their trade. We'll also uncover the keys to The Savoy's success both past and present, charting its renovation in the most expensive hotel 'facelift' in history. But can this most famous, and traditional, of hotels continue to thrive?
