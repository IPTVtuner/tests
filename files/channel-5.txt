A loose-knit group of gentile lady ex-pats adopt illegitimate youngster Luca, and haunt the art world and cafes of Florence, oblivious to the rise of Mussolini's fascists. When the war starts to impinge on their lives, they find themselves interned, awaiting rescue from the invading British and American armies.
