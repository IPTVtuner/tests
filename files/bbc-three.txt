James Blake - a 30-year-old entrepreneur from Lisburn - was living the Insta-dream until someone scraped his accounts. He started getting messages from people accusing him of conning them out of tens of thousands of pounds. As he sets out to try and get his face and name back, James discovers a dark and utterly heartless modern-day crime wave where ruthless organised gangs are using the very latest technology to scam blameless victims out of money.
