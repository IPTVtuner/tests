Janet arrives back from hospital with Wesley and Tim, but there is no sign of Gaz. Later, when he finds out that she has spent the night with Wesley holding her hand he blurts out that he has slept with Donna, so Janet throws him out. Elsewhere, Louise tells Tim she is desperate for a boyfriend, just as ex-boyband member Scott enters the pub.
