The team are on the road for a clash of the heavyweights in Miami. Daniel Dubois and his sister Caroline are two of Shane's latest signings. The tight-knit family are churning out boxing superstars, and much of their work ethic can be attributed to their dad Stan, who homeschooled Daniel and made him train from a very early age. Caroline wasn't forced into the sport, but seeing her brother's incredible successes inspired her to carve her own path.
