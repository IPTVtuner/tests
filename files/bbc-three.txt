The 20-year-olds, Tracey and Becca, are at Teeside Uni studying law. 24-year-old Kaitlin is studying accountancy at university whilst working for an optician. All three are keen to meet guys from further afield to find out if they can find something they haven't yet found with the guys closer to home. Cue the away squad: 20-year-olds Jude and Jacob and 19-year-old Ash. These firm friends met at the University of Lancaster, where they are all studying.
