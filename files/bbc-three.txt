It's week three and clash time! For the first time ever, a solo artist clashes with a duo, leaving tensions bubbling. Artists then must work together with the artist they just clashed with to win the chance of their track featuring in the promo for a major new TV drama. Some tensions are set aside with impressive results, while others struggle to collaborate. Guest mentors include clash legend Chip, Shystie and the cast of Champion.
