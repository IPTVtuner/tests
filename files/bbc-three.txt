Stacey and her gang - organiser Dilly, carpenter Rob and cleaner Iwan - challenge the Wellen family to sort their life out in 7 days. They'll have to embark on a mammoth declutter, and the family will be asked to let go of half of their possessions, so that the team can then beautifully reorganise their home. With Stacey's help, the family start packing all their possessions into boxes.
