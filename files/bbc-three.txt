The world's finest athletes meet in Eugene as the thrilling Diamond League series continues with this season's fifth meeting. Last year, the Prefontaine Classic served as the season finale with some of athletics' biggest and brightest names putting in stellar performances. Indeed, two world records were broken at Hayward Field last September as Mondo Duplantis bettered his own in the men's pole vault, before Gudaf Tsegay broke the women's 5000m record.
