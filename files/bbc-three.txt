It's Day 7 on the island, and the winner of the Earth Power challenge has a big decision to make, as they are asked to pair one of their closest rivals with a new Warrior. Meanwhile, Demitri and the other trainees attempt to make a fresh start following the arguments of the previous day. At the training ground, Adil shows his Warrior, Ty, a fighting spirit which has been lacking until this point.
