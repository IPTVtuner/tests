Chloe, Jack and David are navigating life at Kirkmoore, a residential college for disabled students. Jack is girl-obsessed and determined to get a reluctant David, who just wants to knuckle down and finish his essay, on a night out. Meanwhile, Chloe has an online date she's anxious to go well. As the evening unfolds in less than ideal circumstances for the trio, we see the reality of how life outside the college affects them.
