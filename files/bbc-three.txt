This time features the astonishing, ultra-exclusive Ferrari FXXK, tested to the max by Chris Harris at the Daytona circuit in Florida. Matt, Chris and Rory then race across Kazakhstan in 3 high-mileage cars: a Mercedes saloon, a Volvo estate and a London Taxi, all of which have done at least 480,000 miles, the equivalent distance of going to the moon and back. Actor James McAvoy guest stars in the studio and on the famous Top Gear test track.
