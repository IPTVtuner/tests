Sian's investigation into a reported UFO sighting by 14 schoolboys in a playground in West Wales ramps up a gear. Now she has a tape of hotelier Rosa claiming she saw a spaceship land and two 'creatures' appear weeks before the primary school sighting in Broad Haven. As Sian digs through the original case files, she hones in on rational explanations for what happened, only for new information to suggest there could be some truth to the stories.
