Domino Day is a mixed-race 24-year-old Londoner out on a date with finance bro Jason in a swanky Manchester bar. She works as a barista in a local coffee bar, and also happens to be a witch. The type of witch who needs to feed. Hence Jason. Domino urges them back to his luxury apartment but when Jason tries to attack her, she turns the tables on him, and uses her magic to overpower him, block his memory and feed on him. Little does she know that Jason has secretly filmed everything.
