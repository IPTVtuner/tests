This is an average story of a very average woman. Of Spud, carer for her father, who cooks, cleans and serves badly and half-heartedly. A woman who is never seen or thanked. Ignored. A woman who, in spite of what society tells her, does not feel bad about herself. Who, despite not being young, or a mother, or, worst of all, beautiful, is actually quite happy in herself, if not her life. Then, one day, her dad dies, making her realise that she may have to come out of the shadows and be seen.
