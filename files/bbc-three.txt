Pam and Mick are having second thoughts about the conservatory, whilst Bryn is in his element as he awaits the arrival of his houseguests - all the Essex boys down for a big night out in Cardiff - and having a sleep over at his! Elsewhere, Smithy gets in a state about seeing Nessa after their most recent embarrassing meeting, and Stacey makes a worrying discovery, but is telling Gavin the right thing to do?
