Stacey investigates the growing drug craze sweeping through Thailand. Ya-ba, a dangerous mix of methamphetamine and caffeine, has gripped the nation and unleashed a wave of violence among its users. She uncovers the human cost, visiting a ward full of `zombie' addicts, many of whom face the risk of long-term psychosis, and meets users who have started taking the drug as young as 12 years old.
