Best friends Ryan and Daniel from Belfast want to throw the mother of all comeback shows for their friend and fellow wrestler Shannon. Shannon, aka `Skye James, The Rainbow Rebel' injured herself badly performing her signature move years ago and hasn't stepped into a ring since. The boys are hoping the Big Proud Party Agency can step up and help her get back through the ropes.
