Shane McGuigan and the team prepare for a busy few weeks, with back-to-back fight nights scheduled. First up is Robbie Davies Jr and Ellie Scotney, who are best friends but have never boxed on the same card. This is a must-win for both of them, but especially for Robbie, who is a veteran of the sport and only has a few contests left in the tank. Next up is Chris Billam-Smith, who is in a grudge rematch against a fighter that has history with Shane.
