As journalist Mobeen Azhar nears the end of his investigation into the story behind eight men murdered by serial killer and shopping mall Santa Claus Bruce McArthur, he explores whether there could be more victims. One man who spent an evening with McArthur says police found an eerie photo of him on the killer's computer. McArthur logged his victims by individual folders, but there were more folders than men found in the suburban garden. Mobeen speaks to the sister of a man who remains missing.
