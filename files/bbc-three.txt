Jeremy Clarkson drives the new Jaguar F-type sports car on some of Britain's finest roads; James May takes the New Bus for London for a nice day out in the country; and Richard Hammond tests the new Range Rover Sport off-road, on track and in its most natural habitat, the lanes of Cheshire. Inspired by these machines, the presenters meet up for an epic celebration of all that is great about Britain's motor industry.
