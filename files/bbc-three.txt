Stand-up comedian Josh Jones pits Kristian Nairn and Gemma Bradley against each other in a competition to find the best takeaway in town. Host Josh Jones loves to eat amazing food but, because of his busy work and travel schedule as a stand-up comedian, he usually ends up living off takeaways. But that doesn't mean his tastebuds have to be disappointed, he likes his fast food to be fancy.
