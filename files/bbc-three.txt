South Africa has for years battled the scourge of rhino poaching, fuelled by insatiable demand for their horns in Asia. Ashley embarks on a mission to find out who is behind these brutal acts, discovering how the challenges young men face growing up in deprived rural communities can lead to illegal poaching. Hanging out with men from KwaZulu-Natal - or Zululand - he earns their trust and joins them on a legal hunt for bushmeat in order to understand what day-to-day life is like here.
