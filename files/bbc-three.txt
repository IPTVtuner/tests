Two victims appear to break the mould of Bruce McArthur's killing spree. Mobeen looks at what made McArthur target a happily married man who had lived outside the city. It was a week after Soroush Mahmudi went missing that his disappearance was reported to police. Like the men before, he was brown-skinned, but this time, police stated there was no indication that he had links to the gay village.
