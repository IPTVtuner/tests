Bethan and Poppy get closer, but Bethan's attention is demanded by Lydia and Travis, who drag her into the chip shop where Lydia flirts with the owner, a middle-aged lothario called Tony. Bethan and her Nana visit Trina in the psychiatric hospital. It's a difficult visit and Nana suggests that Bethan comes to and lives with her whilst Trina is in hospital. Later, Bethan is called back to the hospital by someone who tells her that her mum has been killed in a violent altercation.
