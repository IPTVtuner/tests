In the Northern Ireland heat, we meet the Bogmen, three best friends from the heart of Fermanagh, who are up against the Determinators: David, Stephanie and a real life Derry girl, Shannon. Farmer and YouTuber Tom Pemberton hosts as the teams go head-to-head in three high-octane agricultural challenges. The teams are in for a test of raw speed in a drag race and artistic skills in an extraterrestrial mowing challenge.
