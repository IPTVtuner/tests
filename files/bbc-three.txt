Becky and Steve's relationship blossoms above the nitty gritty of living together, but there's trouble on the horizon. Laura and Shelly have job interviews organised by Steve's ex-girlfriend, Dan's back with his girlfriend and is more miserable than ever, and Paul's up to his old tricks again. Meanwhile, Laura has had her bottom pinched outside the flat, and Paul and his mates are determined to get revenge on the pincher.
