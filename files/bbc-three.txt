Brendan has finally been able to fulfil a lifelong dream, to open his own make-up store in Ibiza. Social media whizz Ciara flies back from a launch in Toronto for a photoshoot with actress Jac Jossa on the island. Coincidentally, her boyfriend, Charlie, is also in Ibiza, and the two of them try to sneak off together. They have been in a long distance relationship for five years, so every minute together matters.
