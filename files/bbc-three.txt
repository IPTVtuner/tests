The great mountain ranges are some of the planet's most spectacular landscapes, but they are unforgiving places to live in. Only few pioneering animals have what it takes to endure at extreme altitude. Mountain animals are also amongst the most elusive in the world, yet this film provides unique and intimate glimpses into their secretive lives. Witness the moment four snow leopards come together when a mother and cub become trapped between two rival males.
