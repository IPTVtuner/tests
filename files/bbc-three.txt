The funfair `The Hoppins' arrives in the toon. While Shane conquers a newfound fear of heights on `the bomber', Sammyjo and the girls are running for cover as `the curse of the Hoppins' strikes. Pure Ink piercer Carla is back from a festival, and after a mix up in the mosh pit, she's carrying an injury and wants anyone and everyone to hear her story. Sammyjo turns to friend Frankie for dating advice ahead of a singles night out, while at the salon, there is an unexpected staffroom surprise.
