A cautionary tale about one of the UK's most notorious credit card fraudsters, whose five-year crime wave began at just 16 years of age. While his contemporaries were using fake IDs to get into nightclubs, he was defrauding innocent cardholders from his desk in a call centre, laying the groundwork for a journey that would open up a world of wealth, first-class travel and an escape from the life he seemed destined for.
