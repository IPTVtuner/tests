Jeremy Clarkson and James May pay tribute to quirky and recently deceased Swedish car maker Saab. Also, Richard Hammond races a rocket-powered flying man against a rally-spec Skoda, while Jeremy smokes around the track in the Maserati Gran Turismo MC Stradale and the tyre shredding Mercedes C63 Black. Plus, current `Doctor Who' Matt Smith joins in the fun.
