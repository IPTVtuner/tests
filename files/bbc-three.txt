BBC Three
Today, October 06
Motoring news and views with Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May. The trio take an Aston DBS Volante, a Ferrari California and a Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder to Romania in search of an obscure stretch of tarmac that some hard-core drivers claim is nothing less than the greatest road in the world. James compares two powerful limos, the BMW 760i and Mercedes S63 AMG.
