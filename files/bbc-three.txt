Claudia Winkleman greets 22 strangers as they arrive at a beautiful castle in the Scottish Highlands to play the ultimate reality game of detection, backstabbing and trust, in the hope of winning up to Â£120,000. And it's not long before the players are questioning everything, and everyone, as Claudia secretly assigns three traitors. It is up to the traitors, under the cover of darkness, to pick off their fellow players one by one, murdering them from the game.
