It's Steve's birthday and everyone wants to go out and get plastered - except Steve, who is ill in bed. Or at least he tells his mum and everyone else he is. When Becky, Laura, Shelly and Paul can't persuade him to go out and celebrate, Steve stays in and - with a little help from Dan - makes very good use of his presents.
