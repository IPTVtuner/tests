Mobeen Azhar gets in front of the cop who led the original investigation into the first three missing men, but it's a revelation about a separate assault involving the serial killer that takes his hunt for answers in a different direction. Mobeen meets a man who says he accused the killer, Bruce McArthur, a shopping mall Santa Claus, of assault years before his arrest for eight murders, and he has the video evidence to prove it.
