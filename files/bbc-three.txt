Every second is excruciating for Chloe as she anticipates her release. The conditions that have been set for her by the criminal gang, which include not speaking to the police, fill her mind, and she questions whether she will ever escape this nightmare. She is forced to keep up pretences with MD, and, eventually, he escorts her to the consulate. Chloe is free... but her ordeal is far from over. She is plunged into an intense 15-hour police interview.
