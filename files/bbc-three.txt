BBC Three
Today, November 12
The search for Britain's hottest new comedian has brought us to Bangor, the oldest city in Wales and one of the smallest cities in the UK. Our venue is Pontio Theatre, an ultra-cool arts and innovation centre right in the middle of Bangor University's main arts building, which, for one night only, has been transformed into our very own comedy club. Our host for the evening is north Wales's own Kiri Pritchard McLean.
