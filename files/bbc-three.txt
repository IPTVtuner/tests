Mobeen has landed himself in the prison infirmary, where he also has a mission - to befriend a man known as 'Memory Stick' and convince him to hand over vital information. In the infirmary, he also encounters a doctor, Nida, and there's an instant spark between her and Mobeen. Nida also suggests she can help Aqsa with a placement for her medical degree, which she is thrilled with. Aqsa also receives some characteristically unhelpful advice from prison chaplain Uncle Shady.
