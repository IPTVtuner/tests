The family return from holiday and come crashing back to reality with busy schedules. With Joe on the road and Stacey at home juggling work and family, there is a strained atmosphere coming to a head over some spilled baked beans. As the NTAs loom, Stacey takes a trip down memory lane rummaging through her old X-Factor memorabilia before hitting the red carpet with Zach, as the rest of the family wait nervously at home.
