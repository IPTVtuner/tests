Matt Baker introduces highlights of the men's team final at the European Championships in Rimini, with analysis from Olympic bronze medallist Beth Tweddle. Great Britain earned a bronze medal at last year's championships in Turkey but will be hopeful of improving on that showing. They are boosted by the return to fitness of three-time Olympic champion Max Whitlock, who missed out 12 months ago due to injury. Hosts Italy are the defending champions.
