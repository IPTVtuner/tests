In the final episode, there's a build-up for two world title fights. Chris Billam-Smith and Ellie Scotney have grafted their way to the summit. Ellie may be full of humour and smiles outside the ring, but she is as tough as nails when she's in fight mode. The opportunity is hers for the taking, and she plans on doing it her own way. In the cruiserweight division, CBS has been gifted a dream hometown fight at the Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth.
