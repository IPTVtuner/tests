Stacey tackles the subject of death by immersing herself in the world of undertaking at a century old funeral director's. This film follows Stacey's previous acclaimed documentary from the same production team behind Inside the Convent, where she expressed her fear of death, seeking answers from the nuns she was staying with, but her curiosity wasn't fully satisfied. Stacey's life has since changed; and as a new mother, her worries for the future and about death have only been exacerbated.
