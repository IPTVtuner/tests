Joe returns to Albert Square for the first time in nearly 20 years. Stacey kicks off her vegetable patch with a 2.5-tonne delivery of manure before going home for a quiet Sunday roast, only to discover Joe has forgotten he's invited his entire family over! And after a crazy few months, the couple head out for a much-needed date night at a pottery school, leaving them mucky before a romantic dinner.
