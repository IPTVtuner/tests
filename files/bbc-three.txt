The search for the UK's Next Drag Race Superstar continues. This week, the queens' melodramatic acting skills are put to the test as they star in the romantic dramas Footballers' Wags, Holedark and Femmerdale. Comedian and presenter Joel Dommett joins RuPaul as his extra special guest judge alongside Michelle Visage and Alan Carr as the queens once again fight to stay in the competition. But the question remains: can they survive the dramarama and live to see another episode?
