Four contenders must face our resident superhumans across five brutal events, before going head-to-head in the legendary Eliminator. Who has the will and the skill to conquer the infamous Travelator and win a place in the quarter-finals? In this show, there's more drama than you can shake a pugil stick at when Comet flies in Hang Tough and Diamond races up The Wall.
