Sian Eleri investigates a seemingly ordinary farmhouse in north Wales, which, in the late 1990s, was widely considered the most haunted house in Britain. The story made local and national headlines as the family who lived at the farm became ever more desperate in their search for answers. More than 300 allegedly paranormal events were documented at the Flintshire farmhouse in video footage, audio interviews, photos and eyewitness accounts - all of which has been locked away until now.
