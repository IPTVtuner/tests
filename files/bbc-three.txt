BBC Three
Today, November 27
In a Rap Game UK first - the artists perform at Leeds Festival. For the first challenge, the artists are asked to produce a promo package worthy of gaining online traction. They are then surprised with news that for their second challenge, they'll be performing as a collective on the BBC Introducing stage at Leeds Festival. At the rankings, some artists are left fuming, before Krept drops yet another bombshell! The mentors are Arrdee and NSG.
