In the last show of this series, Jeremy Clarkson races the new Jaguar XJ against something even bigger and more powerful - the rotation of the Earth itself. Meanwhile, Richard Hammond achieves a boyhood dream by testing two 1980s supercar icons, the Porsche 959 and Ferrari F40, and James May is in America to drive NASA's very latest Space Exploration Vehicle.
