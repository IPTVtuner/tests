The BBC's big comedy talent search heads to Northern Ireland and the capital, Belfast, where five hopefuls will battle it out to book their place in Birmingham for the grand final showdown. This show comes from the MAC, an award-winning venue in Belfast's Cathedral Quarter, which is home to all kinds of theatre performances, comedy and music gigs. Since opening in 2012, the MAC has become a beacon for the ongoing regeneration of Belfast.
