It's a new day at Abbey Grove, and as usual, Mitchell and Stephen are totally neglecting their teaching duties. Hoburn tells them that she is going to have to get rid of one of their departments unless they can prove the educational merits of their subjects. Meanwhile Fraser is panicking as he has accidentally sent the entire internet to the printer in alphabetical order and can't stop the continuous flow of print-outs - not a good look when Hoburn is on the warpath over wastage.
