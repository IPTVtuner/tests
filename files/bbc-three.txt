Luke grew up in a white working-class family in Rochdale, but always felt like an outsider. He thought it might be because of his sexuality, but when he came out as gay aged 18, his parents were very supportive, and the feeling did not go away. Persistent questions about his appearance eventually inspire him to take a DNA test and the result explodes his identity, revealing a secret his mum has kept hidden since Luke's birth - his dad is not his biological father, and he is mixed race.
