Sammyjo is back where she belongs, on the floor of Longlox running the show and cutting hair. The boys from Pure Ink, Shane and John, are on a health kick and hitting the gym. John confides in Shane about his health struggles, before Shane takes him on a hair-raising, nail-biting buggy ride to the coast. Boxer Ewan is training hard for the fight of his life.
