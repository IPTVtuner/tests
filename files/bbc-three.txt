The search for the UK's next Drag Race superstar continues. It is time for one of the show's most iconic and difficult challenges - the Snatch Game. Carol Vorderman and Alexandra Burke join in the fun as the queens are tasked with showcasing their best celebrity impressions and their improv skills. But the question remains, who will make Ru laugh, and who will draw some 'blankety blank' stares? Alexandra Burke stays on to join RuPaul on the judging panel alongside Michelle Visage and Alan Carr.
