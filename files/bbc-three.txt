Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May compete in an epic London-to-Edinburgh race, setting out to discover what `Top Gear' might have been like 60 years ago. James grabs himself a gorgeous old Jaguar XK120 sports car, while Richard chooses to torture himself on the Vincent Black Shadow motorbike, and Jeremy takes the Tornado, a new steam train built to the blueprints used to create some of Britain's finest locomotives.
