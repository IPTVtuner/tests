Jeremy, Richard and James attempt to save the planet by building their own electric car, and then put their latest `green' creation through the rigours of the new car testing process. Meanwhile on the track, Europe takes on the USA in the battle of the continents, as Jeremy pits the Corvette ZR1's muscle against the finesse of Audi's R8 V10. The Star in a Reasonably Priced Car is Michael Sheen.
