Journalist Mobeen Azhar travels to Canada to investigate the mysterious cases of men who went missing from Toronto's gay village. It was the summer of 2017, just one day after Toronto's annual Pride parade, and a dark shadow fell over the city's gay area. As the street parties faded away, one man had vanished. His name was Andrew Kinsman. Mobeen looks into what happened and finds that Andrew was a popular guy in the area who was known to keep a regular schedule.
