Live Super League coverage comes from Leigh Sports Village as local rivals Leigh Leopards and Salford go head-to-head. Leigh, who famously won the 2023 Challenge Cup, have got off to a sluggish start this season and will be desperate for a win on home soil to help kick-start their campaign. However, when the sides met in March on Rivals Weekend, it was home side Salford who earned the bragging rights courtesy of a 32-22 victory.
