In this English heat, the all-female Diva Drivers from Leicestershire are determined to outmanoeuvre Somerset's Checkshirt Choppers and win a place in the semi-final. Farmer and YouTuber Tom Pemberton hosts as the teams go head-to-head in three high-octane agricultural challenges. From tractor racing through a muddy bog to negotiating an obstacle course while singing their favourite karaoke tracks and demolishing sheds in a radical ten-pin tractor bowling game.
