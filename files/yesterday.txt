After the plot to get the two British airmen out fails, Maria disguises them as waitresses at the café. Meanwhile, a frustrated Rene returns to the painting of the Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies. He hides it behind an ugly painting in his café which is immediately recognised by General von Klinkerhoffen as a Van Gogh and requisitioned for his office in the chateau.
