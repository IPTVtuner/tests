Fiona and the team are at Minehead Railway Station where spirits are high despite the weather. As the sun breaks through, the treasures begin to arrive, including a chair said to have belonged to Henry VIII and a Butlins dance trophy. The day produces some eclectic finds: a 19th-century washing machine, a historic wedding dress worn by seven brides and counting, plus an exquisite miniature of Napoleon which is guaranteed to create a bidding war among collectors.
