December 1944 and Hitler has picked the Ardennes sector for a major offensive - a last gamble to turn the tide of the war. The surprise attack, spearheaded by elite divisions, initially sends American units reeling. The German onslaught leads to the bloodiest single battle fought by US forces in World War Two. We hear from survivors of SS atrocities against prisoners and civilians, and veterans of the US 101st Airborne's `Band of Brothers' who held Bastogne during a bloody week-long siege.
