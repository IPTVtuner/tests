This special edition of the show, marking 80 years since the start of World War Two, brings fresh insights to the conflict through personal stories and family mementos. Introduced by Fiona Bruce from Dover Castle, where the evacuation of Dunkirk was organised in the spring of 1940, the episode includes the stirring tale of HMS Hardy and its doomed efforts to protect the Norwegian port of Narvik, a mission that secured its captain the Victoria Cross.
