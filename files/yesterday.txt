In Kearny, a place known as Little Glasgow, Billy discovers it was the Scots who brought football to America. Then it's a pilgrimage to the Martin Guitar Company the factory that have built the guitars for some of the biggest rockstars on the planet, including Billy's hero Hank Williams. From there it's on to the tiny town of Stockbridge, home to America's greatest artist, Norman Rockwell and the muse whose bottom appeared on thousands of copies of the Saturday Evening Post.
