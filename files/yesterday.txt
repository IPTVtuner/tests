Fiona Bruce and the team travel to Portchester Castle in Hampshire on the south coast of England, where treasures include an extraordinary set of RAF medals awarded for extreme bravery to an airman who served in Dunkirk and the Battle of Britain. The team also admire some rare punk clothing by fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and a roll of ornate Arts and Crafts wallpaper destined for the bonfire.
