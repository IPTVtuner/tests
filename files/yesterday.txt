Michael Portillo retraces the journeys featured in George Bradshaw's Continental Railway Guide. Leaving London behind, armed with his 1913 guide, Michael follows the most popular route of the Edwardian traveller through France. His first stop is Paris where he absorbs the atmosphere of La Belle Epoque, before he travels south to the Cote D'Azur. He then ends his journey at Monte Carlo's gaming tables.
