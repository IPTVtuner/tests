Antiques Roadshow returns to Castle Ward in Northern Ireland, an unusual 18th-century mansion and backdrop to hit TV series Game of Thrones. Fiona Bruce delves into the story of Mary Ward, a gifted scientist, author and astronomer who lived here in the 19th century. The team uncover some wonderful treasures, including two sculptures made out of ostrich eggs, a set of jewellery decorated with scarab beetles that survived being baked in an oven and a watch designed for astronauts to wear.
