Michael Portillo is in the Scottish Highlands on the last leg of his rail journey through 1930s Britain. He begins in Elgin's port, the coastal town of Lossiemouth, where James Ramsay MacDonald, the Labour Party's first Prime Minister was born. Michael meets his granddaughter to visit the family home and discovers what shaped his politics. On the outskirts of Lossiemouth, Michael finds a remote boarding school established in the 1930s.
