Michael Portillo reaches the capital. In the Queen of the Suburbs, Ealing, he finds comedy at the home of British cinema and is transformed for the silver screen by expert hair and make-up. In Fulham, Michael heads underground to London's new super sewer, which is taking shape beneath the River Thames. In central London, he visits the London School of Economics and Political Science.
