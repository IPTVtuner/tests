Fiona Bruce and the team return to Cardiff Castle. In this Victorian gothic setting, silver specialist Gordon Foster is fascinated by an elaborately decorated Indian flask, while John Benjamin reveals that what was thought to be costume jewellery is actually the real thing. Fiona is on the hunt for a lost 1933 penny worth a small fortune and Henry Sandon gets his hands on a piece of rare porcelain which he has been waiting 40 years to see.
