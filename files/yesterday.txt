The roadshow comes from the foreshore beside the V&A Dundee design museum in Scotland. Fiona Bruce goes aboard the Discovery to uncover the epic story of the ship and Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott. Theo Burrell finds a glass helmet that may not be very practical, and Lisa Lloyd is thrilled by a piece of tartan that has been to the moon and back. Also a collection of Canadian First Nations embroidered clothing intrigues Ronnie Archer Morgan.
