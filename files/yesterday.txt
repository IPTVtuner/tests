Antiques Roadshow returns to the vibrant setting of Morden Hall Park in south London. We discover personal letters written by Mother Teresa and an exquisite bronze by the father of South African sculpture, Anton Van Wouw. There's a colourful collage by the celebrated British artist and illustrator John Minton, and a huge collection of intricately designed silver vinaigrette boxes.
