The show comes from Battle Abbey, where treasures brought along include an incredibly rare Beatles guitar with an enviable history, which turns out to be one of the most valuable items ever seen on the show. Also featured are some royal letters from Queen Victoria's children, a pawned diamond ring that saved a family from the poorhouse, a rare ninth-century gold coin and some valuable Chinese surprises.
