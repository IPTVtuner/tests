Michael Portillo takes the train from the former political capital of Italy, Turin, to Casanova's capital of romance, Venice. Along the way, he recreates the famous `Italian Job' on a historic Fiat test track and follows fashion in Milan before investigating the early 20th century British love affair with Lake Como in a seaplane. In Verona, Michael discovers the `House of the Capulets', bought to attract Edwardian tourists to the scene of Shakespeare's `Romeo and Juliet'.
