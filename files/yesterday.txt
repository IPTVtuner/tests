In the grounds of Salisbury Cathedral in Wiltshire experts discover an eclectic mix of treasures including Napoleon's razor, letters from Enid Blyton and a piece of Queen Victoria's underwear. There is plenty of sparkle from jewellery with a story to tell and artworks including a hand-painted Christmas card from WW2 and original drawings of Judge Dredd.
