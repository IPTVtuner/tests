Armed with his Bradshaw's guidebook, Michael Portillo enters the foul smelling world of a Victorian tannery. In Nailsea, he discovers how mountains of bird droppings made one of the greatest fortunes of the era for a 19th century entrepreneur, who spent his wealth building churches and chapels and one of the most luxurious country houses in Britain. Reaching Glastonbury, Michael heads for the mystical Abbey, where Victorian tourists flocked to hear stories of King Arthur and the Holy Grail.
