Armed with his Appleton's guide, Michael Portillo continues his rail journey through Connecticut and New England. He takes a crash course in rowing in New Haven, where college teams from Yale and Harvard have battled for victory on the water since 1852. In Vermont, Michael visits a 19th-century farm, where the rich milk from prized Jersey cows imported from the British Isles supplied a thriving butter industry.
