Fiona and the team are at Trelissick House and gardens in Cornwall where the locals have dived into skips and cleared out their attics to bring along treasures in all shapes and sizes. There is a giant chair and an escape pod from a Vulcan bomber, whilst at the other end of the scale a miniature sewing kit and a gold snuff box with links to DH Lawrence prove that the best things do come in little packages.
