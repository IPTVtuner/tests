September 1944, Montgomery proposes a bold plan to cross the Rhine and encircle Germany's industrial heartland. Operation Market Garden begins as thousands of Allied paratroopers seize key bridges, while British tanks advance up a single 100km road to link up with them. But major flaws quickly emerge in the Allied plan. Veterans of British 1st Airborne recall going `a bridge too far' at Arnhem, and members of XXX Corps explain why `Club Route' soon became `Hell's Highway'.
