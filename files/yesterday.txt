Billy embarks on his great American trail as he opens the New York tartan day parade to a 30,000 strong crowd. He heads to Plymouth, Massachusetts where the pilgrims first landed on American soil, followed by a meeting with the Native American tribe who almost had their people and language wiped out, until it was revived in a pre-school class of children. Then to Boston, and home to possibly the naughtiest group of nuns on the planet.
