Michael Portillo explores the once great empire of Austria-Hungary, domain of the famous Habsburg monarchs. Starting in Budapest, he travels via Bratislava in Slovakia, to the beautiful and elegant city of Vienna where he immerses himself in pre-war decadence. From there he travels to Salzburg, before heading to the magnificent scenery of the Salzkammergut region.
