Clutching his 1899 copy of Appleton's Guide to Canada, Michael Portillo travels on the Ocean train from Nova Scotia to New Brunswick. Along the way he investigates the world's biggest tide at Hopewell Rocks and admires its dramatic rock formations and caves. He apparently defies gravity on a magnetic hill in a 1965 Pontiac Bonneville. North of Moncton in Miramichi, he joins the Elipogtog First Nation in a pow wow, where he learns about quilting and traditional dress.
