The second in a three-part series which sees Joanna Lumley travel the 6,400 mile route from Hong Kong to Moscow. In this programme, she spends time with some Mongolian nomads, visits a giant statue of Genghis Khan and a gold mine. Joanna spends time in the capital Ulan Bator, where she tracks down the amazing Mongolian throat singers before catching the train to Russia. She meets Mongolian tradesmen on the train and then experiences a spot of bother at the border before she enters Siberia.
