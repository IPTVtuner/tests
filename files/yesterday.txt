The show returns to the magnificent setting of Compton Verney in Warwickshire. Treasures brought in include some hand-painted fashion illustrations from the 1930s, a pair of bronze cockerels from Benin in West Africa and a rare Chinese incense burner worth a small fortune. We meet the granddaughter of the first British woman to win an individual swimming gold medal, at the 1924 Olympics, and military expert Mark Smith hears the extraordinary story of a First World War hero.
