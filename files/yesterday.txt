Fiona and the team are at Dyffryn Gardens near Cardiff in south Wales. Will Farmer is thrilled to see a huge collection of Clarice Cliff ceramics, including many rarities picked up for just a few pounds, while Hilary Kay is amused by a toy figure of a fire-breathing mother-in-law that shoots real sparks. Alastair Chandler is intrigued by a 1960s 'Atmos' clock that runs on air, and Lisa Lloyd admires an ornate Welsh harp, getting to hear it played by a musician who is keeping the art alive.
