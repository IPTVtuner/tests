Fiona Bruce and the team head to Cheshire for a day of busy valuations at Arley Hall and Gardens. Combing through the thousands of objects brought in by visitors the experts are excited to discover two different items that have spent many years hidden from view - a gold bracelet found mysteriously bricked up behind a wall that is linked to a tragic love story, and a time capsule, buried in 1886, is opened on camera to reveal its secrets 130 years later.
