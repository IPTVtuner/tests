Michael Portillo begins a new journey on the tracks of the Ocean line to explore Canada's maritime provinces, en route to Quebec City. Clutching his 1899 Appleton's Guide to Canada, he begins in the Atlantic port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he discovers an 18th century British hilltop citadel, manned at the time of his guide by the 78th Highland Regiment.
