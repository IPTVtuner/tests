Michael Portillo embarks on a railway adventure from the coalfields of South Wales around the Bristol Channel to the southernmost tip of Cornwall. His first stop is Whitland in Carmarthenshire, where in the early 20th century, thrill-seekers gathered on Pendine Sands to indulge their need for speed. Michael joins latter day petrol heads to burn rubber on the beach in an iconic 3 wheeler.
