Following his Appleton's guide, Michael Portillo makes a trip to the jewel in the crown of America's National Parks, Yosemite, to behold its towering granite cliffs, its giant sequoia trees and cascading waterfalls. He discovers how early conservationists fought to protect it in law and encounters a `buffalo soldier' in the heart of the forest. In Berkeley, Michael uncovers a catastrophic event, which hit the city of San Francisco hard in 1906.
