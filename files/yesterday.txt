Starting deep in Virginia on the trail of bootleggers dealing in the illegal drink, moonshine. From there, Billy follows the trail of the underground railroad and the amazing woman who led hundreds of slaves to their freedom, meeting one of the family members keeping her memory very much alive. He then stops off to encounter the baffling sight of a farm filled with giant sculpted heads of all the American Presidents.
