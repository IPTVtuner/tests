In June 1944, the combined American, British and Canadian armies make up the most powerful invasion force ever assembled. They plan to establish a bridgehead in Normandy, storming beaches along a 50-mile front while airborne troops secure targets inland. They face determined German defenders protected by bunkers, obstacles and minefields. David Willey talks amphibious tanks, and Taff Gillingham demonstrates the heavy kit that weighed down the troops as they waded ashore.
