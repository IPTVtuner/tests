René is ordered to hand over the two valuable paintings to General von Klinkerhoffen, who promptly sells them for a million gold bars. René steals four of these bars, and sneaks off to Switzerland with Yvette on the night train. Unfortunately, for one reason or another, everyone ends up on the same train.
