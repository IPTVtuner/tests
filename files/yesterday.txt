Simon continues his journey in Libya, a country well off the tourist trail and torn apart by revolution, insurgents from the so-called Islamic State and western air strikes. He then heads to Tunisia, a country that unlike its neighbour, has long been a tourist destination. Heading deep into the desert, the backdrop for scenes in the `Star Wars' films, Simon visits the fortress village of Chenini.
