Beginning on the Moray Firth, Michael admires the impressive Cullen viaduct before enjoying a bowl of Cullen skink at a family-run fishmonger of 150 years' standing. Heading west along the firth, Michael reaches Forres Station and the seaside village of Findhorn, where he meets members of an eco-community founded in the 1960s. At the Findhorn Foundation, Michael discovers spiritual energy, sacred dancing and a history of very large vegetables.
