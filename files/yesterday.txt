This is the first of a series of journeys along the tracks that helped fuel the Industrial Revolution, which begins in the rolling Chiltern Hills. Michael Portillo meets the remarkable craftsmen behind the Victorian furniture trade, discovers how George Bradshaw helped save Britain's canal heritage, and sees Shakespeare through the eyes of a 19th century railway tourist.
