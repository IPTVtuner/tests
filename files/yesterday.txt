The team return to Helmingham Hall in Suffolk, a Tudor manor house with working drawbridges and stunning gardens. Paul Atterbury meets a man whose family have painstakingly constructed an entire working model fairground, complete with helter-skelter, Ferris wheel and carousel. Fiona Bruce has fun with a unique piece of Donald Trump memorabilia: a vanity set from his private yacht. Also, Clive Farahar values a document signed by Elizabeth I while Mark Smith is enchanted by a rare WW1 medal.
