A three-part series which sees Joanna Lumley travel the 6,400 mile route from Hong Kong to Moscow. Joanna begins her train journey in Hong Kong - which she last visited when she was four - while she has not been to Moscow since 1966 when she was there as a model at the height of the Cold War. In the first episode, she sets off from The Peak above Victoria Harbour, before jumping on the Mass Transit Railway to Shenzhen where she catches the bullet train to Beijing.
