Michael Portillo boards the Great Western Railway at the Cornish seaside resort of St Ives. In Britain's first studio pottery, he attempts a decorative wax technique and feels the heat of the firing kiln. He discovers a Cornish fisherman, who,although he began painting only in his seventies, inspired established artists from the capital.
