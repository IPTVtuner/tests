The roadshow comes from the lush surroundings of the National Botanic Garden of Wales in Carmarthenshire. Fiona Bruce explores the Victorian mania for collecting exotic plants and examines rare species grown inside the gigantic bio-dome. Mark Smith can't believe his eyes when not one but two rare First World War Luftwaffe `honour' goblets turn up at his table, while armourer Bill Harriman can't wait to get his hands on one of the largest muskets he's ever seen.
