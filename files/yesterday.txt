The last leg of her 6,400-mile train journey from Hong Kong to Moscow finds Joanna is in deepest Siberia. First stop is Lake Baikal, one of the deepest lakes in the world. She drinks vodka with a local fisherman before getting back on the train for Krasnoyarsk to meet an oligarch. From there she travels across the vast emptiness of Siberia to Yekaterinburg, a city with a dark history. The last tsar and his family were murdered here in 1918.
