An enquiry is launched when the shocking murder of a teenage girl is shown in an online video. Despite the grainy footage and the lack of a body, the girl and her attackers are identified. However, a vow of silence between the defendants and no further evidence means that Jake and Alesha struggle to assemble a strong case. One key witness could turn that all around, but not without the most personal of sacrifices.
