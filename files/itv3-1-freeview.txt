Fuelled by a cocktail of drugs, Mrs Tishell can no longer hide her unrequited love for the doc, and decides she must take drastic action. When baby James Henry is left in her care, she boards a bus out of the village leaving an enigmatic message for Dr Ellingham to meet them at the castle. The doc is joined by Louisa, who is beside herself with worry, and his Aunt Ruth, as they go off in search of Mrs Tishell.
