When a young female member of a new age cult called The Oblong Foundation goes missing, DCI John Barnaby investigates and sends DS Jones undercover at the cult's base, Malham Hall. The police learn that the hall's previous owners, the Lamberts, died in a gas explosion on board their boat. Barnaby and Jones must try to find out what really happened to the Lamberts - and whether the case has a link to the missing woman.
