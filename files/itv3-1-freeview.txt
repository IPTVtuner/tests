When three people are murdered and a fourth left for dead in a London shop, DS Ronnie Brooks and DS Matt Devlin are up against the clock as they try to find the culprit. Their search is helped by information about the unusual murder weapon - a bayonet. When the investigation comes to court, senior crown prosecutor James Steel thinks he has a fairly open and shut case, but things take an unexpected turn.
