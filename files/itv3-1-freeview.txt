The team work on a case of nine soldiers found together buried in a trench in Belgium at the site of the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. Artefacts found near the bodies and DNA of potential living relatives are used to identify these brave men who lost their lives and to hopefully allow their living relatives to lay them to rest with full military honours at last.
