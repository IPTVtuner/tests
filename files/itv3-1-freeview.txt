What lies behind the door of number 27 The Hill? A routine `domestic' call out to the house leads to a policeman's murder, the prime suspect grievously injured and a shocking discovery. Five young girls have gone missing and the lair of the serial rapist and killer has been discovered, but only four bodies are found. However, the suspect is in a coma, and the ambitious DS Annie Cabbot wants to know why.
