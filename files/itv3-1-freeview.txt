Lewis and Hathaway investigate the death of Professor Miranda Thornton, who apparently killed herself after her dating video was leaked on to a vicious media blog. However, Lewis does not believe that Thornton's death was suicide and he has qualms about the blog's founder, Kit Renton, and the owner of the dating website, Sophie Leland. When one of Renton's employees is found murdered, the police realise she must have been killed.
