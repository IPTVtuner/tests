Danny has a crisis about his age when he hurts his back while helping to build a new school in the township. He feels even worse after the arrival of Lewis, a hotshot young vet recently hired by Rowan. Alice is impressed by Lewis's professionalism, but are his ideas all they are cracked up to be? Meanwhile, Caroline asks Du Plessis to organise their honeymoon - and gets much more than she bargained for.
