Oxford's last surviving all-female college is bidding farewell to one of its most prominent professors. During a reunion of her brightest students, one of the group is found murdered at the bottom of a flight of stairs. Lewis is convinced that the killing is connected to a brutal attack which occurred ten years before and, as the investigation progresses, he and Hathaway are drawn into the mystery of the college and its secrets.
