Police Commander Jack Delany and his heiress wife are found by their housekeeper, brutally murdered. Their identical twin sons are distraught, as is Chief Superintendent Walker - who was a personal friend of the family. Is this a burglary gone badly wrong or a revenge killing? Although Jack Delany was a keen shot, there are no guns kept at the house and no murder weapon has been found.
