As Geordie and Will head to a charity boxing match at Vic's gym, both men put on a brave face and hide the worries haunting them. Geordie's hoping for a 'manly' night at the fight, with Jack and Leonard joining in the fun: an escape from the problems at home and the strain of the job. And Will revels in the night as well, this place giving him the purpose he so desperately needs.
