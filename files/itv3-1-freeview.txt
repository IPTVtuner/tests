Sam and Adam are now running a dilapidated local guest house where Mandy Dean is one of the residents. Disowned by her family, she is a young, vulnerable mother all alone because of the hostility levelled against her and her mixed-race baby. Her ex-boyfriend returns hoping to win her back, but then she is found murdered and the finger of suspicion points to a black GI at the nearby US military base - the father of her child.
