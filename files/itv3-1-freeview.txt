Rachel is angry and upset about missing her sergeant's exam and about Nick Savage not being charged with her attempted murder. Sean tells her he has booked the registry office and, even though she still says no, his relentless cheerfulness makes her smile. Meanwhile, Andy insists that he is prepared to give Janet all the time and space she needs, but then she finds him ingratiating himself with her mother and Elise.
