Will, reeling from his family tragedy and daunted by the choice he now faces, seeks distraction in Geordie's world. A curious new case unfolds: the murder of a Teddy Boy at a dance hall, which Geordie concludes is proof that the country has truly gone to the dogs. It's a view fuelled by the impotence he now feels regarding Cathy's harassment at work and his daughter Esme's teenage rebellion.
