This episode explores the Royal Family's rollercoaster relationship with the press. Managing the media has been one of the most difficult challenges of the Queen's reign. At the time of the abdication in 1936, British press barons could be relied upon to conceal royal scandals from the public, but fast-forward 50 years to the heyday of Diana and Fergie, and royal misdemeanours would inspire a tabloid feeding frenzy.
