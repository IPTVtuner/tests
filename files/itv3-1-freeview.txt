Louise Stoppani is looking for the father she never knew, having discovered aged seven that the man bringing her up was not her biological dad. Her 'real' father was a teenage boyfriend of her mum's who'd wanted to be part of his daughter's life at the beginning but had then disappeared and not made contact for nearly 40 years. Jonathan Gaskarth was adopted at six weeks old and had such a happy adoption that he'd never felt the need to search for his birth mother or father.
