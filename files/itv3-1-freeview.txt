A Cambridge lecturer's fatal fall from the college spires draws Sidney and Geordie into a world of espionage and cover ups, where nothing and no-one is what they seem. Geordie calls on Sidney for help following the apparent suicide of Valentine Lyall at Sidney's old college. Lyall's wife Mya is consoled by Valentine's star pupil Kit Bartlett, who used to partake in daredevil climbs of the college buildings alongside his mentor.
