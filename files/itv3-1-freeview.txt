Investigating the violent murder of a psychiatrist, Ronnie and Joe are disturbed to discover a secret sleeping space in his office, which has clearly been used by one of his clients. Their concern for his underage patients, however, can't distract them from finding the killer who is potentially dangerous and armed with a large hunting knife.
