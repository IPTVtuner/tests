It's Christmas and the troubled Villiers family get together nine years after the death of eldest son Ferdy, a magician. A riddle in a cracker predicts that two people will die before midnight on Boxing Day, then the frail Lydia Villiers is hospitalised after a fall. As Barnaby abandons his Christmas lunch with the in-laws to investigate, it seems as though ghosts from the past are haunting the household.
