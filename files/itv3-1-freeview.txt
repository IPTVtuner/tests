A funfair on Cowley Green turns sinister when bus conductress Jeannie Hearne is spirited away in the night, without any explanation. When her body is found next morning in the Oxfordshire countryside, the case comes to the attention of Oxford City Police. Endeavour is still suspended from duty, but when Jeannie's body is found close to where he is living, the unexplained details prove too pressing to ignore and Endeavour begins a covert investigation of his own.
