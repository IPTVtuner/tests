Martin doesn't take kindly to the influx of holidaymakers, and his attempts to point out the dangers of sunbathing to one woman don't come across very well. Elsewhere, gossip spreads about Martin's phobia of blood and he becomes the subject of a practical joke in the pub, and one of Louisa's pupils has an accident and an ambulance has to be called to take him to Truro for emergency treatment.
