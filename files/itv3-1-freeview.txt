Connor and the team investigate an audacious murder - an ambulance run off the road, and its patient shot in the head. Media interest is high when the victim's identity is revealed - Sebastian Cole, engaged to the tabloids' favourite `It Girl' Imogen Buller-Turi. As the police delve deeper, it becomes clear that this is not a simple case of road rage, and Connor is forced to accept an uneasy professional alliance.
