The family prepare to make their last stand to prevent the mining company from destroying Leopard's Den. Du Plessis and Fatani bring elephants to stand in the way of the bulldozers and a stand-off ensues. In the resulting chaos, Caroline is knocked over by a policeman. When they learn that her injuries are infected, Danny wonders whether they might be better off in the UK - at least until they can find a new home.
