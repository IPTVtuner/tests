Over her record breaking 67-year reign, Queen Elizabeth II has mastered the art of being a monarch, both at home and abroad. This episode examines that reign and uncovers just what qualities are needed to hold the very top job. Elizabeth II inherited the crown at just 25 years old, and coming just a few years after World War II, her glittering Coronation ushered in a new wave of optimism and hope. We meet two of her Maids of Honour who attended to her on the day she was crowned.
