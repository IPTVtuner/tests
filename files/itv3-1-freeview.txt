An abandoned suitcase is found at Heathrow Airport - but this is no terrorist threat. It contains the naked, strangled body of Sofia Petrenko, a high-class prostitute. The case is traced to Vitali Malikov, a Ukrainian billionaire who admits to hiring Sofia's services, but says she was alive when she left him and the case was a gift. Walker arrests Malikov on suspicion of murder, but then is forced to release him.
