When a woman is found killed in a remote cottage in the dramatic Northumberland countryside, DI Vera Stanhope is taken back to a place full of childhood memories - and an unsolved case from her own past. She and her team delve into the local politics surrounding a controversial proposal to dig a new quarry, and find motives for murder in the unlikeliest of places, but the truth could be hidden within the land itself.
