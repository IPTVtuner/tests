When a robbery goes wrong, an innocent have-a-go hero is shot dead and the two thieves take a cab driver hostage as they make their getaway. The police manage to capture one of the suspects, Frank Donovan, who tries to make a deal. Ronnie and Sam have just ten hours to find the hostage before the CPS is forced to agree to Donovan's terms.
