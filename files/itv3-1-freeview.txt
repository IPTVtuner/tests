Today, October 25
Lewis and Hathaway enter the world of St Gerard's Hall when a visiting female bishop is found dead after drinking poisoned wine. Was she was murdered because her liberal views contradicted those of the reactionary religious leaders of the college - or is something more sinister afoot? When another two deaths occur, both mirroring murders from Jacobean revenge tragedy, Lewis and Hathaway realise that something twisted is afoot.
