With Danny away and Du Plessis undertaking an stretch of community service, Ed is left in charge of running the Endangered Species Project. He meets a beautiful stranger called Kim Ferreira, who tells him that she has a lion that carries the Barbary gene. Du Plessis arrives in time to hear Ed ask Kim out, and is incredulous when she accepts - while Ed is furious with Du Plessis for stating Kim may have an ulterior motive.
