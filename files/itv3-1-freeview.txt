Barnaby's secret past as a spy is revealed when a former agent is found dead after a cricket match in Midsomer Parva. While locals blame the brutal killing on the `beast of Midsomer', Barnaby suspects otherwise. He soon finds links to a network of spies that operated in Cold War Berlin, but his investigation is obstructed at every turn.
