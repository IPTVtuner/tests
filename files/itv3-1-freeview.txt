A tragic communication error between police officers leads to the death of gay PC Nick Bentley when he is caught in the crossfire of armed drug-dealers. One of the dealers claims that a second police officer, Ray Griffin, was standing nearby doing nothing while Bentley bled to death. When Griffin is linked to an extreme religious group which discriminates against homosexuals, an awful truth emerges.
