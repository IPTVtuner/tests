After a break-in, a frail elderly woman named Jenny Moran is found dead in her flat by her neighbour. Tipped off by the victim's granddaughter Connie, the investigation focuses on the old lady's live-in carer Cecile Bakama, who is promptly arrested. Cecile blames Connie when the post mortem confirms that starvation was the cause of death.
