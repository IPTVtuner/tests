A reclusive couple are found dead, victims of a supposedly botched burglary which shocks the occupants of the village of Dunstan. Then, a guest is murdered at the wedding at one of Jones' oldest friends. Could this spate of killings be connected to a mystery of a fatal road accident, and the disappearance of a teenager 20 years ago?
