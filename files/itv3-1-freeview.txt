Today, January 12
Martin makes his debut on a local radio station - but doesn't make a great impression on the interviewer, Bert and Al argue over Al's plans to go to college, and a nasty stomach bug sweeps through the village - but is the swimming pool or the water to blame? Meanwhile, Louise is keen to make amends with Martin, but then Mark invites himself along too.
