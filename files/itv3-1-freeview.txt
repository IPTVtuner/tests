When a girl falls to her death from a ferris wheel, it is thought to be a tragic accident until DS Satchell's aunt - a fortune teller at the fair - comes forward with her suspicions of foul play. Her fears seem well grounded when a second death occurs, and it appears that all is not fun at the fair.
