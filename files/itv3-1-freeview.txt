Sleepless nights are taking their toll on Martin and Louisa and tempers are starting to fray. Aunt Ruth has problems of her own - a thief has stolen the hub caps from her car. The thief is identified as Michael Dunwich, who lives with his mother Shirley on a neighbouring farm. Later, Shirley tells Martin about her crippling stomach pains and reveals that she thinks her son is trying to poison her.
