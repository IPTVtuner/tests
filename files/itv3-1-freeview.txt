The manhunt zeroes in on the small village of Rothbury - following the discovery that press attention is antagonising Moat, the police request a media blackout. Information comes to light that Moat has all the survival skills to last for weeks on his own in the woods - the police therefore enlist the help of a survivalist expert, but Moat continues to elude them.
