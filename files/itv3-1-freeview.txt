Today, January 01
Comedy about a young English aristocrat who, unjustly disgraced by accusations of cheating, joins the Foreign Legion and comes across a Bilko-like sergeant with a fort full of nervous legionnaires. With trouble brewing, the new recruit is forced to show his metal and, hopefully, win back the heart of his lover.
