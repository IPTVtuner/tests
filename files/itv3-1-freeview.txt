A Catholic father-of-four is arrested after a prostitute is found murdered, but he denies the crime. Beck returns from sick leave to work alongside Penhaligon, who is privately convinced that Beck raped her but has no forensic evidence. While Fitz faces a family tragedy, a second prostitute is attacked while the chief suspect is still in custody.
