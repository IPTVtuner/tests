The body of a teenage girl, Maria Cole, is discovered in a chalk pit. The tracks of three vehicles are found at the crime scene, leading Connor and Walker to local hardman Ray Harper. Ray's son Andy and his friend Darren admit being at the pit on the same night but claim they never saw the girl. Cracks start to appear in their story when CCTV footage reveals that they crossed paths with Maria just before she died.
