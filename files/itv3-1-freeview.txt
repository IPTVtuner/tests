Gill and Rachel go to Bristol to advise on a rape and murder case which bears striking similarities to an infamous case from 13 years ago. At the time of the original investigation, Gill helped catch the perpetrator, Jeremy Leach. Leach was convicted for the rape and murder of four women but now he is claiming that he is innocent. Later, another woman is raped and killed using Leach's exact MO.
