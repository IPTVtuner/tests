DS Brooks, DS Devlin and DI Chandler investigate when a homeless man is found beaten nearly to death in the park at the centre of a well-kept square. As they dig deeper, they discover that the man tormented some of the local residents, giving several people a motive. A respectable resident of the square is arrested, but Senior Crown Prosecutor James Steel fears that the jury will sympathise with the alleged attacker.
