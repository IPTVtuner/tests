The drama about a curmudgeonly country doctor and his patients in Cornwall returns for a seventh series. Martin returns to Portwenn, but without Louisa. She has gone to stay with her mother in Spain to take some time out to think, and Martin is left wondering if she will ever come back. Aunt Ruth has found him a therapist, but life in Portwenn continues to get in the doc's way - in the form of Steve Baker and his lifeboat training exercise.
