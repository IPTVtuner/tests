A change of circumstance puts Bertie Pelham in the limelight, and Edith must decide whether to conceal her past at all costs or confront the truth and risk losing everything. As both sisters seek their perfect match, hostilities escalate and it is up to Mary to decide if she can ever make peace with Edith - or herself? Spratt proves to be a man of hidden talents and Mr Molesley embarks on a career in teaching, though his first lesson does not quite go to plan.
