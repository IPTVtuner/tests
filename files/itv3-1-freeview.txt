Inspector Lewis investigates the death of Regan Peverill, a brilliant young maths student at Oxford University. The prime suspect is Danny Griffon, an ex-boyfriend and fellow student. Danny is convinced that his uncle has set him up and old case papers belonging to Morse indicate that the Griffon family have a dark secret to hide.
