Samantha Stobbart strikes up a new romance with Christopher Brown - she is increasingly nervous about her abusive ex-partner Raoul Moat being released from prison, where he has been serving a short sentence for assaulting a child. Moat refuses to acknowledge that their relationship is over - possessive and pathologically jealous, he becomes incensed when he learns about Sam's new partner. Upon his release, Moat commits a brutal and violent crime.
