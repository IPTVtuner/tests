When prison warder Charlie Tyner is found shot dead on a council estate in Hackney, it soon comes to light that he was corrupt and had taken advantage of his position. Plenty of prisoners inside had good reason for wanting him dead but, being locked up, they all have solid alibis. Crown prosecutors James Steel and Alesha Phillips find themselves at odds with their boss who is keen to bring the killer to justice.
