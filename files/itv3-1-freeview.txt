Fitz is back in the UK after 10 years living in Australia. He leaps at the chance to help police crack the random killing of a well-connected American comedian and is soon on the trail of a troubled ex-soldier, who is trapped in the past. Tormented by his experiences in Northern Ireland, Kenny is haunted by the ghosts of his comrades and feels their deaths are seen as insignificant since 9/11 and the war against terror.
