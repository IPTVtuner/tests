Rumours are rife about Martin's plans to leave Portwenn and take up a surgeon's job in London. An insecure Pauline confronts him about her future and Martin offers to write her a reference, but it all ends in tears. At the surgery, a worried Joan Norton brings in Ted to be examined, suspecting he may have had a heart attack, and Martin attends a medical conference at a hotel where Edith is giving a key speech.
