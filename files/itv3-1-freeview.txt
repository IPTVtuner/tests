Will and Leonard witness a deadly and deliberate hit-and-run in Grantchester. Geordie traces the car to a pair of decidedly dysfunctional brothers whose house lies far off the beaten path. The victim's wife, his employee and the two brothers are all damaged characters caught in a web of lies and betrayals, and it is not just secrets that are hiding within the brothers' grounds. And at home, Will and Geordie both struggle as unwelcome guests look set to stay.
