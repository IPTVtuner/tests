When a petty criminal makes a deathbed confession about murdering a teenage girl, Ronnie has to re-open a 14-year-old case he was involved in during his drinking days. Now sober, Ronnie is shaken to the core when he has to revisit the case, which he thought he had put to bed a long time ago - not least when he is forced to question the conclusions he drew when his mind was clouded by alcohol.
