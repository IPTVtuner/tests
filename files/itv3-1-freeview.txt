The collapse of Owen Pierce's trial has left the case wide open and a killer still on the loose. Banks sets out to collect watertight evidence against Pierce, who is still his prime suspect, but Morton tries to persuade him to keep an open mind. Then promising new information leading to Tyler Judd comes to light, and it looks as if the team might finally be closer to the truth behind Ellie Clayton's murder.
