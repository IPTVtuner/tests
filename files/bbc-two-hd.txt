Paul Whitehouse takes Bob Mortimer on the ultimate fishing adventure to the magical country of Norway, where the locals say that cod is God and fishing takes precedence over almost everything else. This is Paul's type of Christmas break, and it will be the first time they have fished together beyond the UK and Ireland.
