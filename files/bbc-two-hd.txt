Will Shakespeare's been working on his masterpiece. His friends tell him it's his greatest comedy yet, but Will insists that `Hamlet' isn't actually meant to be funny. In the meantime Greene has hit on an ingenious new way to destroy Will's reputation by excluding him from his high-brow literary set, and Marlowe's reputation is in such a bad way that he could really do with being dead for a bit.
