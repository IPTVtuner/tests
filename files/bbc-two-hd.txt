James Crawford reveals how planners and architects took to Scotland's skies after World War II and used the God's eye view in their mission to redesign towns and cities across the Central Belt. From one of Scotland's first tower blocks, to New Town living, to the building of a motorway that ripped through the heart of Glasgow and the vision to cover it up, James reveals how these utopian and controversial visions have transformed our lives and how we're living with the legacy to this day.
