Alfred Hitchcock's classic about two men who plot a perfect murder. When tennis pro Guy Haines meets smooth-talking Bruno Antony in the bar car of a train, he finds the stranger sympathetic with his desire to be rid of his clinging wife. The sinister Bruno then proposes that they swap murders: Bruno will murder Guy's wife, and Guy will do away with Bruno's father.
