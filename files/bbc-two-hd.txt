In the Cairngorms, hill farmer Johnny, 69, and his son Raymond, 47, bicker and banter as they gather in their sheep on a cold snowy day. They are bringing them in for pregnancy scanning and mineral dosing, but Raymond also has a second, posher pedigree flock tucked up nice and warm in a polytunnel back at the farm, Scotland's first Valais Blacknose sheep from Switzerland.
