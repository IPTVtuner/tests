Living in the depths of the New Guinea rainforest are the spectacular birds of paradise. Filming their bizarre courtship displays is the holy grail of wildlife film makers. David Attenborough has been entranced by these birds since he was a boy and he narrates as a team of New Guinean naturalists embark on a gruelling expedition to try to film ten birds of paradise deep in the heart of the rainforest.
