Faith Oscott delivers a passionate speech during the barrister's strikes in 2022. Two years later, a case she is defending falls through because a witness doesn't turn up. As she is driving home, she calls her wife Lucy on the phone, who derides her for being late for their young son, again. Suddenly, she is forced off the road by a moped rider, and as she gets out to confront them we see terror on her face. Days later, a woman's hand is found in a canal.
