Continuing her journey north along Russia's border, Katya travels from Estonia into snowy Scandinavia. In Finland, a country scarred by past war with Russia, she discovers a state of hyper-preparedness as she travels deep into the bunkers beneath Helsinki. In Norway, she finds a more relaxed attitude, but one where personal relationships are breaking down in all sorts of ways - between reindeer herders, families and nuclear scientists.
