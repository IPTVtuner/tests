Cameraman Jeff Turner spends a year in Canada's frozen north following Storm, an extraordinary wolf whose pack was first featured in `Frozen Planet.' Jeff follows Storm's pack as they hunt the giant buffalo herds that roam the area and learns how they survive in this harsh wilderness - and whether Storm can pass his hunting skills on to the new generation of wolf cubs.
