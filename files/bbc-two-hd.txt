Top criminal barristers Sasha Wass QC and Jeremy Dein QC explore a grisly Victorian-era murder. Lancashire, 1863. On a cold January evening on the outskirts of Haigh, near Wigan, engine tender James Barton started his night shift at the Bawk House pit. He was carrying his prized silver pocket watch. Workers arriving the following morning were mystified to find that James wasn't there, and a frantic search for him began. As the sun came up, signs of Barton's grim fate emerged.
