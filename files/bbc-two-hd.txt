Stacey and her gang - carpenter Rob, cleaner Iwan and special guest Mrs Hinch, who's standing in for Dilly - challenge the Farrow family to sort their life out in seven days. To achieve this, they'll have to embark on a mammoth declutter. They ask the family to try and let go of half their possessions, so that they can then beautifully reorganise their home. With Stacey's help, the family start packing all their possessions into boxes.
