Simon Reeve explores Australia. His adventure starts in the `red centre' of the continent and onwards through South Australia via the extraordinary Indian Pacific Railway, until he reaches the west coast city of Perth. On the way, he joins an Aussie rancher in the parched outback and visits the lucrative tuna fishing city of Port Lincoln. Finally in Perth, Simon discovers a full scale British invasion.
