On 7 July 2005, bombs are detonated at Aldgate, Edgware Road and Russell Square. An hour later, another bomb blows up on a bus at Tavistock Square. The police had no idea it was the work of suicide bombers. At the same time, at Cobra, the prime minister demands answers. Forensic officers carry out a detailed search, and a CCTV coordinator steps over body parts at Tavistock Square, trying to find evidence.
