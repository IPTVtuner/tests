It's the 20th anniversary series of Great British Menu, and four chefs compete for Northern Ireland with canapes, starters and fish dishes celebrating great Britons of the past for a banquet at historic Blenheim Palace. The dishes are judged by Michelin-starred chef Angela Hartnett, and they include a fusion dish of ajo blanco and vine leaf dolmas, and four dishes that each use a different fish: brill, coley, cod and sea trout.
