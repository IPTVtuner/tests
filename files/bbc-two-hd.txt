Gregg and Chris head to Cardiff to meet Steph and Matt, parents to seven-year-old William and four-year-old Alex, with another baby on the way. Matt and Steph are stuck in a food rut due to William's serious food allergies. Following an anaphylactic reaction at the age of three, William cannot eat certain foods, including nuts, sesame seeds and flax seeds. As a result, the family are brand-loyal to particular products that they know William can safely eat.
