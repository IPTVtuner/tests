Roo Irvine treads the boards of Belfast's Grand Opera House to learn about the architect who put the grand in the theatre's name! In blue are Anne Marie and daughter-in-law Jemma. Their high jinks certainly keep Thomas Forrester on his toes. On the other team are Caroline Hawley with Debbie and son-in-law Jacob. They're 'red, red ready to win'. Only the bidders can decide, with a little encouragement from auctioneer Jonathan Esdale.
