Miriam arrives in Broken Hill, heading into the Outback town to see how people creatively reinvent themselves in a place built on legends and traditions. As she drives into town, the famous mines are everywhere. They brought tens of thousands to the Outback and built the place, but the mines are dwindling, and so is the population. She checks into the iconic Palace Hotel, where 'Priscilla: Queen of the Desert' was filmed, learns about the local community, and joins a walking drag tour.
