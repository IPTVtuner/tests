Fiona Quigley shows us how to hang a door, Jake Robinson builds a desk from perspex, and we learn everything from how to make planters out of wooden pallets to upcycling a garden bench. Jay also has some great demos himself on how to make your own mail and key holder, a handy laptop stand and even how you can create homemade dishwasher tablets.
