England men's preparations for this summer's World Cup continue as they host Pakistan in the second of their four-match T20 series at Edgbaston, Birmingham. Pakistan are touring England for the first time since 2021; they lost the three-match series 2-1 despite a 31-run victory in the first game at Trent Bridge, which featured what remains their highest total in a T20 match of 232/6.
