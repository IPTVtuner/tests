Hoping to make healthy sales at the famous Bowhouse indoor market in Fife are two Scottish farming families. To try and squeeze more income from their milk, husband and wife Robert and Jane, along with their son Ben, now make 27 tonnes of award-winning cheese each year on their 660-acre dairy farm. The Bruces have given up their careers to start a small farm growing botanicals to make into spirits and liquors.
