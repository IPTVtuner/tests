Skirting the northern edge of the Mendips in Somerset, hidden by rolling hills, lies Chew Valley, named after the River Chew that winds its way into the first of two man-made lakes. Betrayed by a patchwork of arable crops and livestock grazing in fields, agriculture has shaped this landscape for centuries and continues to do so. Joe Crowley has come to see how a recent pioneering woodland project hopes to benefit both cattle and the environment.
