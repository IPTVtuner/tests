Steve Brown's escapees from a large Buckinghamshire town want to relocate to the fabulous Fens to start a glamping business, so at least an acre of land is a priority. Steve meets another couple who are about to start building the house of their dreams by recycling as many materials as they can from a derelict 250-year-old farmer's cottage and barn.
