Sean Fletcher and Anita Rani explore the rugged hills and valleys of West Exmoor, where landscape-scale change is occurring with the introduction of large animals to aid nature restoration. Sean meets some unusual ecosystem engineers - a herd of water buffalo, set to be released to create wetland habitats. He also helps round up 23 Exmoor ponies ready for their annual health check.
