England, Scotland and the other qualified teams learn who they will face at 2024's continental showpiece in Germany as the draw is made in Hamburg. The finalists will be split into six groups of four teams based on their ranking. Euro 2020 runners-up England are expected to be among the top seeds, meaning they would avoid other pre-tournament favourites such as France in the group stage. Introduced by Jason Mohammad, with Jonathan Pearce overseeing the draw.
