Danny Sebastian gets all revved up at the National Motorcycle Museum in Solihull. It's the largest British motorcycle museum in the world with more than 1,000 machines in the collection! On Danny's tour, he's shown a single seat folding motorcycle that was dropped by a parachute during World War Two and rescued from the banks of the Rhine, as well as a golden motorbike built in 1938 for speed and luxury. Meanwhile, two teams go full throttle around an antiques fair in Naseby, Northamptonshire.
