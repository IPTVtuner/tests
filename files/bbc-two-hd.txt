Gabby Logan has a compelling evening session of stellar athletics action from the Commonwealth Arena in Glasgow as the World Indoor Championships continues. Eight gold medals will be claimed tonight, with the home crowd cheering on Scotland's Laura Muir as she competes in the 3000m in search of her first World Indoor title. Other finals include the men's and women's 400m, with the latter potentially featuring outdoor world 400m hurdles champion Femke Bol.
