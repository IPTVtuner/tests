Great Scott! Roo Irvine gets behind the wheel of a DeLorean DMC-12, the car that famously featured as a time machine in the 1985 hit movie, Back to the Future. Built on the peace lines in Northern Ireland, the DMC-12's design was ahead of its time, with its angular, stainless-steel bodywork and eye-catching, gull-wing doors. At the Ulster Transport Museum, Roo meets two men who test-drove the first cars to come off the production line.
