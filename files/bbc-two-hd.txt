Godfathers of alternative comedy Alexei Sayle and Nigel Planer embark on a road trip reunion. In their 1969 MGC Roadster, they're taking in the sights across wild and wonderful Northumberland as they search for antiques to flip for profit. Helping them zero in on profit are antiques gurus Natasha Raskin Sharp and James Braxton. Alexei and Tash's eclectic taste sees them swipe up a yellow chair, a French light fitting and a bronzed pug.
