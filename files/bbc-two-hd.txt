Every day this week, celebrity contestants Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, Ania Magliano, Joe Swash and Jasmine Takhar take on a series of quiz rounds selected by the host, quiz legend Richard Osman. A daily winner is declared following a quickfire round at the end of each show, and the scores are tallied across the week, resulting in an overall champion being crowned on Friday.
