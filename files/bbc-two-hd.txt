Today, July 25
Live and uninterrupted coverage as the Manchester Originals play their first match of this year's Hundred looking to finally lift the trophy after defeats in the last two finals. They suffered heartbreak for the second successive year at Lord's losing the final to the Oval Invincibles by just 14 runs. Their opponents today, the Welsh Fire, will be looking for revenge after the Originals pipped them to a spot in last year's Eliminator by the narrowest of margins on net run rate.
