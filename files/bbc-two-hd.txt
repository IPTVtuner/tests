Presenter James Crawford takes to the air to discover how the wild landscapes of Scotland influence sporting lives. He travels to the volcanic landmark Ailsa Craig, on the trail of the best curling stones in the world and follows their journey from quarry to Olympic ice. In the Outer Hebrides he tracks down a golf course, designed by the founding father of course design that was almost lost to history, buried in the wild landscape of South Uist.
