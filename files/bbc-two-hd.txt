Sunny Somerset is the stage for a road trip with two titans of theatre, film and TV: Amanda Barrie, the unforgettable star of Carry on Cleo and Coronation Street, and the indomitable Stephanie Beacham, queen of Dynasty and co-star to Marlon Brando. With £400 burning holes in their designer handbags, they have experts Tim Medhurst and Serhat Ahmet to help spend it wisely, and a 420 G Jaguar is their swanky classic car of choice.
