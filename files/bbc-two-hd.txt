Summer is in full swing. In the Cairngorms, Robert's cattle get their first taste of freedom and fresh grass. Jenni's alpacas meanwhile, need a short back and sides from a specialist shearer. In North Uist, the herd is being prepared for an epic journey across a tidal sandbar, linking the stunning island of Vallay to the mainland and the croft's bulls. And in Moray, Nikki and Ollie are at last about to complete one of their holiday pods.
