Nick Knowles attempts to give urban spaces a reverse makeover. The team meet Betty from Crayford, who cannot understand why she never sees butterflies these days. She has put up bird feeders, but has failed to attract any feathered friends. In fact, she misses wildlife so much that she has gathered a menagerie of plastic animals to fill the gap. Ripping out tons of concrete, the team fill her garden with trees.
