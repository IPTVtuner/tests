Criminal barristers Jeremy Dein and Sasha Wass look back at the case of John Dickman, who, after being convicted of murder in 1910, became the last man to be hanged at Newcastle Prison. On Friday 18 March 1910, 44-year-old John Nisbet boarded a 10:27am train from Newcastle Central Station. By the time the train reached the end of the line, he was dead. He had been shot five times; his bag, containing Â£370 in cash, had been stolen; and his body had been stuffed beneath the carriage seats.
