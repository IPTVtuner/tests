Classic Ealing comedy about a scotch-laden ship that runs aground off the coast of the Outer Hebrides during the Second World War. The local islanders have depleted their supply of the amber nectar and are overjoyed at the thought of stocking up again. However, it is Sunday, and the teetotallers object to making free with the unexpected cargo.
