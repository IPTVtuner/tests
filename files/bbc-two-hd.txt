The keepers at Longleat Safari Park are getting to know three very special new arrivals - cheetah brothers Adjani, Temba and Lunis. They have a vital mission: to make a love-match with hand-reared female Xena. With only 7,000 cheetahs in the wild, they are at a real risk of extinction, so captive breeding is vital to secure their future. Zoologist Megan McCubbin is tested when she is asked to identify which of the brothers is which, a task that sounds easy but is in fact incredibly difficult.
