The life, times and crimes of Bob Dylan obsessive, AJ Weberman - an irreverent and witty exploration into one man's obsessions, a bohemian life lived on the New York fringes and a twisted take on the American Dream. Both hilarious and disturbing, the film is an observation on our unbalanced desires to know more about celebrities and how far we are willing to go to get that information.
