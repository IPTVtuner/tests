Sabrina Grant presents as a team of expert crafters transform unused objects into contemporary and functional items. A beautiful and unusual Polish cloak is brought to the workshop. It belonged to Linda's musician father, who was born in Poland. He wore the cloak when playing at events celebrating Polish folk music. Now it is a connection to music and her dad, but Linda would love to see it become something she can see and use every day.
