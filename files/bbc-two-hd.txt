The ten remaining sewers celebrate fashion and textiles from India. Kiell Smith-Bynoe and judges Patrick Grant and Esme Young are joined by a special guest judge, Priya Khanchandani. The Pattern Challenge takes inspiration from the jacket popularised by the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. In the Transformation, the sewers are challenged to make an outfit from two fabrics originating in India, calico and Madras cotton.
