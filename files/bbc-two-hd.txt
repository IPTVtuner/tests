For almost 200 years, the UK and Ireland's lifeboat stations have always been at the heart of their local communities. In Larne, Northern Ireland, father and son duo Frank and Jack respond to reports of a kayaker who has failed to make it back to shore. On the south Devon coast, the Torbay crew race to the rescue of a dinghy that's run aground on rocks in a perilous position. In Cardigan, two capsized kayakers provide the crew with a stern test.
