Music box expert Stephen Kember and furniture restorer Will Kirk join forces to tackle a very special music box damaged by a bomb during the Blitz. Unfortunately the box's owners, who were in the house at the time, were killed by the blast. Now their descendant, and custodian of the box, Roger, wants to restore the box so he can hear the same music the family members he never knew used to listen to.
