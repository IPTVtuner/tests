Bargain Hunt time travels back to the 1970s. Eric Knowles meets a Lincolnshire lady, Simone Radley, who's turned the clock back 50 years and scoured the internet and antiques fairs for hip and funky finds from the dazzling disco decade to completely refurbish her house. Over at Hemswell antiques centre, the reds and blues are hoping their items will make groovy profits when they take them up the road at North Hykeham to auctioneer Colin Young.
