Jacqui Joseph is at High Wycombe recycling centre on a mission to save three upcyclable items from an untimely end in landfill and sell them on for a profit. Designer Sarah Peterson looks to stitch together a plan for a 1920s sewing table, and upholsterer Ollie Clueit comes up with a creative idea for a pair of rundown dining chairs. Meanwhile, Jacqui hopes to add a pop of colour to a table and stool set in need of a revamp.
