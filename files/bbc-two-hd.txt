Katherine Ryan welcomes back six up-and-coming jewellers to the workshop to create beautiful pieces in two new challenges. They design and create a must-have pearl chain necklace in the Bestseller before making a specially commissioned charm bracelet for a couple wanting to celebrate their family journey in the Bespoke. It's up to expert judges Dinny Hall and Shaun Leane to decide which jewellers will continue their jewellery-making journey and who will be sent home.
