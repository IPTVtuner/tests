In central Australia, Brolga, the world's most famous `kangaroo mum', is learning what it takes to look after his extended animal family. The three emu chicks are beginning to wreak havoc, the camels are rapidly outgrowing their backyard enclosure and Pete, the southern hairy-nosed wombat, is proving to be quite a handful. To help, Brolga's looking to move some of the animals to his 80-acre sanctuary.
