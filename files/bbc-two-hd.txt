What started as a hobby for dad Jeff has now become a full-on family business with his two charming Mancunian daughters Tracy and Karen as they make honey in Perthshire, Scotland. Meanwhile, young couple Connie and Tom are following their dream of becoming organic vegetable growers on their modest two-acre smallholding in East Neuk. Both of these ambitious families are out to sell what they can at the legendary Bowhouse indoor market in Fife.
