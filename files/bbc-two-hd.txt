Ainsley Harriott is serving up dishes that are delicious but also easy on the wallet - good quality and good value. The menu includes a `Bake Off' masterclass featuring Sussex suet pond pudding, a James Martin tomato soup with garlic bread, the Hairy Bikers' version of a ploughman's lunch and Ainsley's own perfect potato tart.
