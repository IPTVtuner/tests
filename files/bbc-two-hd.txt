The media campaign reaches across the world, but they're not getting press in Russia. They manage to persuade Sir Paul McCartney to write Putin a letter asking for the release of the Arctic 30. Finally, they get widespread coverage of the Arctic 30 story throughout Russia. The piracy charges against the Arctic 30 are replaced with hooliganism, giving Greenpeace an opportunity to appeal for bail again. After the judge retires in court to receive a phone call, the activists are given bail.
