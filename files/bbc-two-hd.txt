Jacqui Joseph is in Buckinghamshire, determined to stop quality items being crushed at High Wycombe recycling centre. She sees potential in a drop-leaf table, a collection of canvas frames and a monk's bench, and enlists the help of upcycler Tristan Merriam and woodworker Martin Hough to try to bring them back to their best. Will Jacqui succeed in sending all three revamped items off to new homes?
