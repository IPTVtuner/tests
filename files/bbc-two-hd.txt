Leading criminal barristers Sasha Wass QC and Jeremy Dein QC investigate their first Scottish case, the murder of a reclusive pensioner nearly 70 years ago. Two men stood trial, but just one person was executed for the crime. Lanarkshire, 1952. On a Sunday in August, two men stopped to check on pensioner and hermit Michael Connelly, known affectionately as Old Mick, at his tiny ramshackle hut. Inside they found his dead body, beaten and bloody.
