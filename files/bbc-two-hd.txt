Archaeologist Ben Robinson explores Parkgate, on the estuary of the River Dee in Cheshire. Today the village is landlocked, cut off from the Dee and the Irish Sea due to the estuary's shifting silt. But 250 years ago, it was a bustling harbour and as Ben finds out from Dr Gillian O'Brian, Parkgate was a gateway for thousands of Irish immigrants from the 1620s onwards.
