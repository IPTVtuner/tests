A US Cavalry officer performs his last duty before retiring, escorting two women civilians to a stagecoach. The trio soon run into trouble in the form of hostile Indians. The second in John Ford's cavalry trilogy, the film produced an Oscar for Winton C Hoch's cinematography and one of John Wayne's finest performances - as a man learning to accept the relentless march of time.
