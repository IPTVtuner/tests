Loved-but-unused treasures are transformed into contemporary and useful items by a team of expert crafters. Sabrina Grant hosts as the owners part with their possessions, returning later to see what they have become. Jane brings in her late mum's wedding dress, pink suede jacket and what her mum called her `smart dress'. She cannot use them, but cannot bear to part with them either.
