Presenter James Crawford takes to the air to uncover some remarkable forgotten histories, travelling back in time to our ancient past. He begins his journey with Scotland's lost canal just outside Glasgow, and then travels back to the heyday of airship travel, the abandoned island of Mingulay, and the dark history of Inchkeith Island in the Firth of Forth. He ends on the Isle of Lewis where archaeologists have recently discovered what might be a lost stone circle.
