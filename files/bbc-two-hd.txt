Fiona Bruce and the team visit the county of Moray in the north of Scotland. Brodie Castle has been home to the Brodie clan for some 800 years, and Fiona discovers the area's ancient history in the form of the Rodney carving, dating from the 8th century, when the area was inhabited by the Celtic-speaking Picts. The Picts were known for their intricate carvings of people and standing stones like the Celtic cross that now stands proud in Brodie Castle's grounds.
