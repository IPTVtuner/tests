Fred Sirieix is heading to Yorkshire in the company of Britain's queen of baking, Nadiya Hussain. Nadiya loves Yorkshire and believes the food scene is one of the UK's most varied due to its spectacular natural landscapes that each tell a different culinary story. She is in fact married to a Yorkshireman, and lived in Leeds for nearly 10 years, so is the perfect guide. Fred is in for a real treat, from incredible bakes, to authentic Indian eats, world-class cheese and the freshest crab.
