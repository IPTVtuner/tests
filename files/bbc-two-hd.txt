Charlie Ross is in South Yorkshire, where he meets rocking horse collector, designer, and restorer Anthony Dew. They chat about the long history of the toys right back to the very first rocking horse, said to have been made for King Charles I when he was a child in 1605. In Elsecar, two teams gallop around an antiques centre with their experts David Harper and Izzie Balmer, trying to find three items each to sell at auction.
