Paul and Bob head to the beautiful River Ouse in the heart of Bedfordshire. The river was once famous for barbel, but has recently become renowned for its big perch instead, a fish that has so far eluded them. After a long day fishing under the summer sun on the Turvey estate, Bob prepares a dinner that Paul will never forget - slow-cooked tripe.
