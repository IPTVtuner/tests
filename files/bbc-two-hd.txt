Dame Mary Berry knows a thing or two about cooking up a fantastic feast, so she's sharing her cooking skills with three novice cooks. Rima, her mother-in-law Diane and her best friend Noreen want to throw a spectacular surprise 30th birthday feast for Rima's husband Mark. They need Mary's help to give Mark a birthday surprise he'll never forget. Mary has also enlisted the help of Strictly's Janette Manrara and presenter Scarlett Moffatt.
