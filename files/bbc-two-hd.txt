Anita and Matt are at the lowest point in the UK, the Fens, to explore the way wildlife and people coexist at and below sea level. Matt helps with a peatland health check and learns that the historic draining of the Fens for agriculture had a lasting environmental impact. Wet farming techniques called paludiculture offer an alternative future for fenland farming, and Matt checks out innovative trials growing crops on waterlogged land.
