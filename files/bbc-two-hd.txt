With over 7,000 livestock being shown, and an expected turnout of 250,000 people, Adam Henson and Charlotte Smith are at one of the largest agricultural shows in Europe - the Royal Welsh. On the 120th anniversary of the show, Adam follows one Hereford cattle farmer as he prepares his prize cows for showing, and he steps into the ring to help judge the young pig handlers competition.
