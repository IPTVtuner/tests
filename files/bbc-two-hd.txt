Owain shows friend and pop sensation Ian H Watkins around a Step-tacular, tiny home in the historic town of Stratford-upon-Avon. Martel meets a DJ with a damp problem at a mid-terrace in Preston. And we jump into the Hammer time machine back to 2007, when Martin visited a barnstorming farmhouse in Lincolnshire.
