Charlie Dimmock and the Rich brothers, David and Harry, look back at some of their most exotic Garden Rescue transformations, projects influenced by far-flung countries and cultures, from Malaysia to Zambia. They include a Caribbean garden full of tropical planting, an Eastern paradise with a centre-piece moon gate, a Japanese garden complete with a yoga deck, and a tiny backyard transformed in the style of the Mughal Empire.
