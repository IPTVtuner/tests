Students take on lecturers in a battle of the brains! In red are friends Amy and Laura, who study history and maths - which they hope will be an ideal combination for bargain hunting! Their opponents in blue are Karen and Nick, who plan to 'teach the reds a lesson.' With pride at stake, both teams dash around an antiques fair in Wetherby in search of three profitable items to sell at auction.
