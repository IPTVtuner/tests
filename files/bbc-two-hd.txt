Raymond focuses on tomatoes, opening with a simple recipe for a salad inspired by his mother. The lightest tomato essence is not only a dish in itself, it forms the base of a fresh yet creamy risotto. A supper dish of stuffed tomatoes glazed with cheese takes us back in time and for the finale an impressive tomato themed series of ices and sorbets cleanses the palate with elegance.
