The small hamlet of Botallack was once at the centre of the Cornish tin and copper mining industry as archaeologist Ben Robinson discovers. By 1861, Botallack's mine was one of the biggest in the whole of Cornwall. Ben explores the village's mining past with archaeologist, Adam Sharpe, where he learns the mines produced millions and millions of pounds worth of copper and tin.
