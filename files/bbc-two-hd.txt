Michael Portillo crosses the Great Plains of Canada by rail, armed with his 1899 Appleton's Guide. He digs into the region's indigenous past at the longest running archaeological excavation in Canada, discovers an Englishman whose work earned him the title Canada's Wheat King, and in the cultural hub of Saskatoon he learns how to make a traditional Saskatoon berry pie.
