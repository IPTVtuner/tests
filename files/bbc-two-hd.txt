On the Devon coast, presenter Caroline Hawley is collecting seaweed as she remembers a bygone pastime. She learns that Victorian women were discouraged from studying botany, so they gathered seaweed specimens to take home, press and dry. A few of these amateur naturalists even discovered new species, which were named after them. Over in Exeter, two teams dash around a huge indoor antiques fair in the company of their experts, Kate Bliss and Ben Cooper.
