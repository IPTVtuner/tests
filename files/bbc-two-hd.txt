Chris and Jordan are in the south west, just outside the city of Bath, with the Forsyths, a busy family in need of a mealtime miracle. Richard is a freelance writer, and Helen runs her own marketing agency. They are parents to 13-year-old Eddie and 10-year-old Elsa. Like a lot of working parents, they struggle to find a work-life balance. Richard works from home and is usually responsible for dinners, but it's a job he dreads, as the family all have different dietary needs.
