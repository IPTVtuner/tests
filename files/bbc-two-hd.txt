Live coverage of the quarter-finals from London's Queen's Club as the leading men look to go deep into a tournament that will likely be their last before Wimbledon. Jack Draper is the big home hope heading into Queen's, but the quarter-finals proved to be a step too far in 2024. The British number one was unable to back-up his heroic victory against Carlos Alcaraz in the second round, instead falling to eventual champion Tommy Paul in three sets. Presented by Clare Balding.
