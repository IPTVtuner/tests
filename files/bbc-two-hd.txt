Dallas Campbell and Dr Hannah Fry explore what it takes to bring the citizens of the sky back to the ground. Dallas has a front row seat, when he is in the cockpit with one of just 26 pilots in the world qualified to land at Paro, in Bhutan. Meanwhile Hannah meets up with the air traffic controllers who, at sometimes of the year, deal with over 1000 flights a day arriving at Atlanta - the busiest airport in the world.
