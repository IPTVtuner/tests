Spring marks the start of an epic race for life where timing is everything; trees explode with blossom and mornings fill with the magical chorus of bird song. Long tailed tits frantically build nests, whilst in our oceans, seahorses sway to a graceful courtship dance. As we celebrate Easter, a stoat mother hunts the young rabbits to feed her own playful young. As spring becomes Summer, Guillemot chicks leap from their cliffs to begin life at sea, and this years young prepare for life alone.
