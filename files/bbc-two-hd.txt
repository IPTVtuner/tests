Starting in Kent and (breakdowns notwithstanding) heading for an auction in Windsor, doyenne of the deadpan Paul Merton and his wife and fellow comic improviser Suki Webster clutch everything from a millennia-old ammonite to a set of bridge pencils. Along the way, the couple discover something of their adopted county's fascinating - if violent - agricultural past.
