While Top of the Pops celebrates its Silver Jubilee, a new showrunner brings the show to an ever younger audience with lively new presenters: step forward Anthea Turner, Nicky Campbell et al. The charts are full of sparkling box-fresh pop stars, from teenage heartthrobs Bros, to the boy and girl next door we shared teatime with every weekday, Kylie and Jason. Plus Stock Aitken and Waterman.
