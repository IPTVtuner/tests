At NHS Lothian's Royal Infirmary, consultant cardiothoracic surgeon Renzo Pessotto takes on some of the most challenging cases in his field, and his next patient is no exception - a 78-year-old with a failing heart and a rare tissue disorder that affects just one per cent of the population. At St John's Hospital, 16 miles west of Edinburgh, complex surgery is also on the agenda for consultant plastic surgeons Ewa Majdek-Paredes and Neil Cahoon.
