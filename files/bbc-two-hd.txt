Chris Packham and Michaela Strachan broadcast live from the Longshaw Estate, where the nests they've been watching for weeks are bursting at the seams with fledging chicks. Who will stay and who will go? Iolo Williams is in the wildlife hotspot of Mount Stewart on the banks of Strangford Lough, and the show continues to celebrate the wonderful cast of British wildlife up and down the country.
