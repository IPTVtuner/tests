Chris Bavin has a new partner by his side, dancer, radio presenter and busy father of two, Jordan Banjo. They head to Scotland to meet Karen and taxi driver Andy, who live near Glasgow and are parents to five-year-old triplets Alyssia, Poppy and Caleb. Two years ago, they were given the devastating news that Caleb had an aggressive brain tumour. Caleb spent a year in chemotherapy, and at the end of 2019 his first treatment was complete.
