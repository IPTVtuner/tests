We're back in the Cumbrian fells with 16-year-old shepherdess Katie and her family on their upland farm for this year's Countryfile Christmas. Sammi Kinghorn and Joe Crawley join in with Katie's festive traditions to celebrate Christmas on the farm. Katie shows Sammi just how busy the farm is during the holiday season, checking up on livestock and tackling daily maintenance.
