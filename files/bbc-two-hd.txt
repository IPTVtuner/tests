Deborah Meaden has taken time out of her busy schedule to lend a hand to the B&B team, but she has a unique connection to the sea, making this visit even more personal for the TV star. This stay is also an experience of firsts for Deborah, who has never been to Northern Ireland before, never ridden a horse in the sea before and - wait for this - never cooked a meal before. Sharon and the team hope to see if this dragon can take the heat in the kitchen.
