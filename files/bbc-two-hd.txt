We say goodbye to a Longleat legend, celebrating her life and the impact she's had on keepers and visitors. Hippos arrived in the park from Uganda nearly half a century ago, and ever since, they've been park favourites. We hear from a keeper who remembers the day well, and keepers who have loved working with them over the years. Sadly, hippo Sonia disappeared, and a few days later was found dead. We hear her story and the reactions from the keepers.
