Our presenters look back on their wild adventures with some of nature's heavyweights across North America. The continent has a very special place in Gordon Buchanan's heart. He once spent a year in the vast forests of Minnesota, getting to know a family of wild black bears. For Chris Packham, meanwhile, it's North America's coastal regions that are it's greatest asset. He recalls a magical moment when a sperm whale popped up alongside his boat.
