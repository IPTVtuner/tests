Highlights of what could be a decisive third game of the four-match T20 series between England and Pakistan in Cardiff. This series will serve as a warm-up for England, who are hoping to defend the T20 World Cup in June in the West Indies and USA. They beat Pakistan in a nervy, low-scoring final to win the title by five wickets in 2022, a victory that made Jos Buttler's side the first ever to hold both 50-over and T20 World Cup titles simultaneously.
