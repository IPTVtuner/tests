A crack troop of Nazi paratroopers is sent to England to kidnap Winston Churchill and transport him to Germany. An English-hating Irishman is recruited by the Germans to spearhead the plan. If the attempt to snatch the British Prime Minister succeeds, the course of the war could be altered. Can the plot be stopped? Based on the fanciful bestseller by Jack Higgins.
