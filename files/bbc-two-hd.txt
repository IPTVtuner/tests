Gregg and Chris are in Bromley with a family who desperately want to change their ways. Busy mum Clare and daughters Rachel and Sadie all rely on dad James to cook the family meals, but not everyone is satisfied with what's being rustled up. With the same meals on rotation and a lack of fruit and veg being consumed, the whole family are bored when it comes to mealtimes. To keep everyone happy, they often resort to eating out.
