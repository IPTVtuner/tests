The explosive Super League season continues with coverage of a West Yorkshire derby between Leeds Rhinos and Castleford Tigers at Headingley. Last season, the Rhinos won this fixture 46-0, running in eight tries, three of which were scored by winger David Fusitu'a. The sides also met on last year's Magic Weekend at St James' Park in Newcastle, where a late try from Jason Qareqare gave Castleford a thrilling 26-24 victory that ended a six-game losing run.
