On 16 June 1971, Michael Parkinson walked down those famous stairs for the first time and introduced the first ever Parkinson show. The guests were celebrity snapper Ray Bellasario and comedy actor Terry-Thomas. Seen as a temporary ten-week filler programme, it went on to record over 650 episodes featuring interviews with over 2,000 guests and was voted by the BFI one of the top ten UK television programmes of all time.
