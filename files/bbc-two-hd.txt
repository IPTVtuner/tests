Super League action from Headingley as Leeds Rhinos seek to avenge their opening day defeat by local rivals Wakefield Trinity. Trinity registered a hard-fought 14-12 victory at this stadium on their return to the top flight in February after two tries from Max Jowitt and another from Mason Lino. The Rhinos have surprisingly failed to reach the play-offs in each of the past two seasons but are determined to put that right under Australian head coach Brad Arthur.
