Top criminal barristers Jeremy Dein QC and Sasha Wass QC re-examine the case against a young farm labourer convicted of the brutal murder of a travelling watch repairman in 1880. On a cold February morning in 1880, a travelling draper was walking along a country lane on the border of Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire when he spotted a hat on the ground. He stopped to pick it up and made a grisly discovery.
