Live coverage of the penultimate Diamond League event of the season from the iconic King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels. Known as the Memorial Van Damme, the event is one of the most eagerly anticipated dates on the athletics calendar. One of the highlights will be an attempt by Norwegian superstar Jakob Ingebrigtsen to break the 2000m world record that has stood since before the 22-year-old was born. The reigning 1500m Olympic gold medallist is looking to lower the mark of 4:44.79.
