The world-famous salmon run arrives in Alaska. The bears must catch hundreds of these fish if they are to bulk up and survive the harsh winter months. We discover that young grizzly mum Parsnip and her cub Pushki have returned to the bay to feed on the salmon. Predatory adult bears will kill cubs and, with fierce competition, Parsnip must protect her cub and learn the skills of fishing.
