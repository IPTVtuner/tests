Grab a cuppa and watch Roo Irvine present a special show on a subject close to her heart - Asia! From Japanese cabinets to Indian silver bowls - this show highlights some Asian gems our Bargain Hunt teams have purchased in the past and counts down the most profitable pieces at auction. Along the way, Roo also learns about the ancient art of Japanese block printing. She also looks back at when Eric Knowles met auctioneer Leon Ma to find out more about a fascinating collection of Chinese ceramics.
