The Great British Sewing Bee does its bit for the planet with Reduce, Reuse and Recycle week. Host Sara Pascoe invites the nine remaining home sewers to create a quilted patchwork jacket from a load of old scraps from past Sewing Bees. Next, in the Transformation Challenge, the sewers breathe new life into boring old coats by completely deconstructing them and refashioning them into brand new stylish outerwear.
