First in the barn are mother and daughter Halina and Lesley with a treasure from World War II in desperate need of jeweller Richard Talman's expertise. The broken, silver ring belonged to Halina's mother, Janina, who was born in Warsaw, orphaned at just 13 years old and taken in by a convent close to the Jewish ghetto in the city. She was given the ring as a thank you from a Jewish woman after she risked her life passing food through the fence to families imprisoned in the ghetto.
