Roo Irvine is in Glasgow for a special show about tiny antiques and collectibles. At the University of Glasgow, she leafs through some of the smallest books in the world, including a Bible just 45 millimetres long, while another tiny text from the 17th century contains a warning handwritten by its previous owner! In a city famed for its art nouveau architecture, Roo reports on one local photographer who is making exquisite replicas of some of Glasgow's best-known cafes and pubs - in miniature.
