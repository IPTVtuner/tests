Fiona Bruce and Philip Mould investigate a charming little white flower picture, purported to be by one of the most important abstract artists of the 20th century, Piet Mondrian. Its owner, American Jeffrey Kroll inherited the picture from his mother and believes it to be genuine. However, the painting was turned down by the authentication committee, so the team will have to find new evidence to help persuade them to change their mind.
