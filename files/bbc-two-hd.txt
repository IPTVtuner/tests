Mammoth is a brand new comedy show about the life of PE teacher Tony Mammoth. Mammoth is a man literally out of time. In 1979 he was a happy-go-lucky PE teacher, leading a school skiing trip to the French Alps. Life was good. Right up until an avalanche decided to ruin his day by sweeping him away, to what was surely his certain death. A certain death which would break the hearts of all the kids that he taught, almost all of his colleagues, several mothers, and devastate his best friend, and wingman, Roger Buck. Except, of course, Mammoth didn't die. He was miraculously found and brought back to life, 42 years later. A perfectly preserved man in his forties. Just one born 86 years ago. For a time he was a global phenomenon. The world was his oyster. But Mammoth has never really liked oysters; he's more of a pub lunch and a pint sort of bloke. He was given the one thing that everyone at some point wishes they were given - a second chance at life. An opportunity to right wrongs.
