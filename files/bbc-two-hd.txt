Nigel Slater shows that spicy food isn't all about hot chillis. Using a range of everyday spices, he creates a week's worth of tasty dishes that will appeal to everyone. Thai spiced aubergines, chilli feta and a quick korma are all simple dishes that combine warm and hearty spices, but don't burn your mouth. Nigel also visits Liverpool to visit allotment holders Rachel and Paul.
