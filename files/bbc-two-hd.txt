Stacey and her gang - organiser Dilly, carpenter Rob and cleaner Iwan - challenge the Seabrook family to sort their life out in seven days. In order to do this, they have to embark on a mammoth declutter. They ask the family to try and let go of half their possessions so that they can then beautifully reorganise their home. With Stacey's help, the family start packing all their possessions into boxes.
