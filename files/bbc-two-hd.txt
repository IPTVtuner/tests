This deep and ancient forested gorge runs through the African savannah and for years, it has been cut off from the rest of the jungle, leaving the chimps imprisoned. Here, they face a daily life-or-death dilemma; whether to leave the safety of the gorge and venture into the predator-ridden savannah to find food, or face hunger.
