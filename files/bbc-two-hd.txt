Charlotte Smith and Sean Fletcher are on Hengistbury Head in Dorset, where a large-scale engineering project is set to save huge swathes of this coastline from being lost to the sea. Sean jumps in a digger and joins the team reconstructing Long Groyne - a breakwater that, after 85 years of service, has reached the end of its lifespan. He learns how marine life will be offered new, artificial reefs to colonise around the new groyne.
