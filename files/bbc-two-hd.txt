Business woman, social media phenomenon, reality TV star and self-declared diva Gemma Collins goes in search of her family history. She knows quite a lot about her dad's side of the family, but nothing about her mum's - beyond the fact her mum Joan was fostered as a baby. It's a subject they've always found difficult to talk about, but now for the first time, Joan has agreed to share with Gemma what she knows.
