Today, December 10
Turn the Gogglebox on and tune in to see Martin and special celebrity guest presenter Scarlett Moffatt take a tour of a Sunderland property that has them looking to break out the champagne. We also delve into the archives from 2007 to see a London studio flat that's at a price Martin just can't believe. And X marks the spot for some dodgy patio doors for Jacqui in Surrey.
