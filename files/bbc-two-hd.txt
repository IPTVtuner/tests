Many brands say they are doing their bit for the environment, even big polluters like tech, energy, and airlines. Now, Panorama investigates the green projects that say they can help brands cancel out their carbon emissions. But do the claims stack up? The programme visits several environmental projects and uncovers evidence of sexual harassment, raises questions about how money is spent and reveals how part of a protected rainforest is being destroyed by major construction work.
