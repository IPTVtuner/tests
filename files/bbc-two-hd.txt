The story of London art curator Ben Moore and Art Wars NFT project, the sale of over 1,100 Stormtrooper helmets. Based on the Star Wars universe, Art Wars was a collection of over 1,100 Stormtrooper helmets, bearing customised designs by some of the biggest artists in the world, from Jake and Dinos Chapman to Anish Kapoor and Damien Hirst. But the helmets being sold didn't exist in the real world - these artworks were only available online as NFTs, or non-fungible tokens.
