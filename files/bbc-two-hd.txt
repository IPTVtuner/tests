It's summer and with increasing numbers of Brits holidaying at home it's an ideal opportunity for Sainsburys to cash in. Can key Cornwall stores Newquay and Bude take advantage or will the great British weather and the M5 ruin their plans? Bristol depot manager Mike battles with traffic to deliver enough products for the holidaymakers, and in Penzance the fridges break down on one of the hottest days of the year.
