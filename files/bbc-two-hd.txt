In the busy skies above our planet we'll meet a creature that creates sound out of thin air with the world's fastest courtship display and arguably the worlds most aggressive bird, harnessing cold aggression to protect its patch of sky. In a South American jungle we'll unravel the secrets of night time `hunt and evasion' flying, as bats and moths fight for the upper hand in one of the worlds oldest arms races.
