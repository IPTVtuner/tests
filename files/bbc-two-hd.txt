Best pals Amanda and Alan take on their first major renovation project, transforming the old dining room into a Tuscan living room. Failing to reach agreement on the colour scheme, the two venture off to try and get some inspiration from the colourful fishing village of Riomaggiore. Colour choice becomes the least of their worries though, when they discover the windows of their 17th-century home are unsalvageable and must be made from scratch.
