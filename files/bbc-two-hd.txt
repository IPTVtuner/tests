`Strictly Come Dancing' head judge Shirley Ballas investigates a family story that her maternal great-grandmother abandoned her husband and children for a more exciting life in America, and what she discovers casts her great-grandmother in a completely new light. On her father's side, Shirley pursues a rumour that she has black ancestors: a trail which leads her to colonial Cape Town and the era of slave trafficking to South Africa via the Indian Ocean.
