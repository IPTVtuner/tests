Tanya Arnold presents comprehensive coverage as England take on neighbours Wales at Headingley Stadium in Leeds. Fresh from qualifying for their first ever Women's Rugby League World Cup, due to take place in 2026, Wales will hope to fare better against England than this time last year, when they went down 60-0 at the same venue. However, under new head coach Stuart Barlow, they have won all three games so far and can boast amongst their ranks the new Woman of Steel Georgie Hetherington.
