Hannah takes a look at the vacuum cleaners, going behind the scenes with Dyson and discovering how the motor in their latest vacuum spins nine times faster than that of a Formula 1 race car. She finds out why a wheezy janitor in the 1900s took inspiration from a sewing machine to create the first popular, portable vacuum. And she comes face to face with a colony of creepy crawlies whose job is to help us fight the filth.
