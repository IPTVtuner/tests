Stacey Solomon returns with a Christmas special where friends and family join her to create ingenious, homemade gifts and decorations that she hopes will bring joy and wonder without blowing the budget. This year, she'll be throwing a special Christmas party to say thank you to the volunteers who have been working throughout the year to help those in need. With five kids to keep occupied, and Jo leaving for a work trip, Stacey will need all of the help she can get.
