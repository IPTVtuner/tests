Plantswoman Carol Klein shares with us a year in her garden at Glebe Cottage in North Devon. March and April is a time of huge change in the garden, as the remnants of winter make way for the hope of spring. Carol is busy clearing away the last of the winter detritus to make way for waves of planting. There's pruning to be done and she sows the first seeds of the year.
