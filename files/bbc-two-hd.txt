JJ Chalmers is at Wallyford recycling centre in East Lothian, on a mission to save three items with the potential to be revamped and sold on for cash. A white kitchen dining set proves to be the ideal blank canvas for upcycler Sarah Peterson, an old bookcase needs a makeover from woodworker Tibby Singh and a potentially collectable rocking horse poses a challenge for JJ. Can he get it past the post and produce a profit?
