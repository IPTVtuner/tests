From the small screen to the silver screen, Charlie Ross celebrates a dazzling collection of film, TV, and theatre antiques and collectibles. It is lights, camera, action as he catches up with six teams of bargain hunters on the hunt for merchandise, memorabilia, and props. Along the way, Charlie gets a snapshot of the history of stills cameras, and Christina Trevanion visits a cinema built in a back garden.
