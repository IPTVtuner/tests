It's harvest time, but not as we know it, as Matt Baker and Charlotte Smith visit a farm in Cambridgeshire growing something rather unusual for the UK. Charlotte meets pioneering farmer David Mwanaka, who raises crops from his native Zimbabwe. It's not the first time they have met. Eleven years ago, Charlotte interviewed him for a radio show on a plot of land in north London and admits she thought David's dream of African crops in the UK was not going to succeed.
