Watch the best of the action from the thrilling final day as the fate of the Solheim Cup is determined, with Europe hoping to secure an historic hat-trick of wins over the United States. The cup was decided by only two points in 2021 and by just a solitary point in Gleneagles in 2019, so a tight finish seems inevitable around the Finca Cortesin resort in Casares, Spain. Suzann Petterson has included English duo Georgia Hall and Charley Hull and Scotland's Gemma Dryburgh in her talented squad.
