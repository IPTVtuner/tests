The Diamond League series continues with the penultimate meet of the season as all-star Olympians from Paris 2024 resume their rivalries in Switzerland. 2023's event in Zurich was a standout, as American sprinters Sha'Carri Richardson and Noah Lyles both won ahead of going on to secure gold medals at 2024's Olympic Games, while three-time world champion and 2020 Olympic champion Karsten Warholm lost his first Diamond League race in five years.
