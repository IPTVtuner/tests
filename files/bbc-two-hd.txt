An old man whose wife has just passed away uses his free local bus pass to travel to the other end of the UK, to where they originally moved from, using only local buses, on a nostalgic trip but also carrying his wife's ashes in a small suitcase, `taking her back' and in doing so he meets local people. By the end of his trip he's a celebrity.
