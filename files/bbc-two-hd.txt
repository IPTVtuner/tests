Gordon Buchanan joins a group of Bushmen in Botswana's Kalahari Desert to learn how to survive on foot among wild lions. The Ju/'hoansi Bushmen teach Gordon their ancient survival secrets - how to make fire, find honey and gather water from desert plants. He sees them hunt with poisoned arrows and track predatory lions. These big cats are a terrifying presence, but can Gordon be brave enough to help his tribal family approach them on foot to retrieve meat to feed the tribe?
