We meet seven-year-old Virsaviya, who was born with her heart on the outside of her ribcage. Desperate to find someone who could help, Virsaviya's mother moved them from Russia to the US where scientist Dr Bob Adelstein, a molecular biologist, is at the cutting edge of research into this rare and life threatening condition.
