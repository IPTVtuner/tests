Lying off the North Sea is the unassuming Suffolk village of Orford. It's behind a large shingle spit called Orford Ness. But as archaeologist Ben Robinson unearths, it's been at the forefront of defending the British Isles for over 800 years. Today its imposing castle built by Henry II is being conserved by English Heritage. Curator Dr Shelley Garland explains the process to Ben and how they've devised the best way to preserve its crumbling stonework.
