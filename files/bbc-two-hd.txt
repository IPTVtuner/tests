For many farmers, summer means one thing - show season - and the Royal Highland Show is the highlight in the calendar. The Barclays boys are showing pedigree Beltex and their finest Suffolks before going head-to-head in the Young Handlers competition. It's also a major event for budding young farmers Rachel and Camy, who, for the first time, are showing only animals raised on their own farm. Hopes are pinned on their Cheviot lamb Patch to prove she's every bit as good as Camy predicted.
