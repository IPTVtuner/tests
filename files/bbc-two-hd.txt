It's Children's Week in the sewing room, and Sara Pascoe invites the sewers to make a cute sailor suit for a toddler. The task requires them to make elasticated shorts and a top with a square collar and ties. For the Transformation Challenge, the sewers turn old school clothes into a cool outfit to be seen in outside school. Then things get scary when mini-models enter the sewing room for a Halloween-themed Made to Measure.
