Simon Reeve travels from the islands of the Aegean to Greece's capital, Athens. To learn more about Greece and the Greeks, he meets an extraordinary cast of characters, from gun-toting priests to the last remaining sponge divers. Getting behind the postcard image of this beautiful country, he finds out how the Greeks are coming to terms with a seemingly endless crisis.
