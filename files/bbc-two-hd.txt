Michael Portillo arrives in Calgary, in the Canadian province of Alberta, steered by his 1899 Appleton's guide. Sporting a bright red jacket, he saddles up with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, hears about their origins and learns about their role today. He tastes life as a ranch hand at Bar U Ranch, where he discovers how the cattle business boomed after the arrival of the transcontinental railway in 1885.
