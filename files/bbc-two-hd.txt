Roo Irvine is on a voyage of discovery in Belfast, where she goes on board the SS Nomadic, the 'little sister' of the Titanic. The Nomadic was built more than 100 years ago as a tender ship, transporting passengers from the dockside to board White Star Line's ocean-going liners. Her early years were spent in Cherbourg before she served as a troop carrier during World War II. At a busy antiques fair in County Antrim, things are looking shipshape for the teams.
