Ben Robinson travels to Cushendall, one of the finest planned Georgian villages in Northern Ireland. It was owned and shaped by a series of owners but most notably its 19th-century merchant landlord Francis Turnly. The forward-thinking man hoped to try out his ideas for a new global order - ideas akin to such organisations as today's UN and the WHO. He also built an intriguing tapered tower, from which he rang a curfew bell to keep his villagers in check.
