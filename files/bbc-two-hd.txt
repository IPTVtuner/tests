This week the Antiques Roadshow is at the historic Stonor Park in Oxfordshire, where treasures include a genuine LS Lowry painting and a little brooch with a big history. There is also plenty of intrigue from far-flung lands, including tribal spears from the South Pacific, ancient carvings from the Indian subcontinent and an intriguing wooden carving with a mysterious past.
