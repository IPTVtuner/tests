Today's show comes from a bustling antiques fair in Detling in Kent, where two teams browse jam-packed stalls with the aim of buying three items in an hour to take to auction. The red team, friends Bill and Al, known as Del Boy and Rodney to their friends, are led around by expert Catherine Southon, while the blues, performing arts teachers Jo and Simisola, are treated to the dry wit of expert Mark Stacey.
