Christina is in the county famed for its ceramics to host another contest between two bargain-hunting teams. Staffordshire is also the birthplace of Wade Pottery and a postwar collecting phenomenon. From the 1950s onwards, Wade made Whimsies, small solid porcelain animal figures that are still collected today. Christina meets an avid collector who owns pieces worth hundreds of pounds. At Uttoxeter Racecourse, brothers Alistair and Dominic rummage for bargains with their expert Jonathan Pratt.
