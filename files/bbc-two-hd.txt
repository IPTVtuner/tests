The semi-finals come to an end, with a stunning task that will require the five remaining chefs to draw on every reserve they can muster, if they hope to make it to finals week. The five professionals are heading to Surrey, home to RHS Garden Wisley, which houses the headquarters of the Royal Horticultural Society, celebrating its 200th anniversary that day. In honour of this milestone, the five contestants will be asked to create a three-course menu.
