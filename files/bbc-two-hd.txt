The show comes from the grounds of Wollaton Hall, an imposing Elizabethan mansion in Nottingham. Having once served as Wayne Manor in the Dark Knight trilogy of Batman films, Wollaton Hall is the perfect backdrop for Fiona Bruce as she tries to guess the value of Batman's mask, his utility belt and the Joker's suit, as worn by Jack Nicholson.
