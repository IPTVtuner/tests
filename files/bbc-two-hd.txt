Broadcasting icon Sarah Greene teams up with Jacqui to explore a three-bedroom terrace in Northampton, where the work is already underway. We plunder the Hammer archives to show off one of Dion's first auction lots, a converted 16th-century chapel. And fast forward to the present day, where Dion's in Stoke to view a three-bedroom detached property undergoing a terrific transformation.
