Derek Brockway gets walking for Children in Need. On his eight-mile hike between Margam and Rest Bay in Porthcawl, he tries everything from sailing to surf lifesaving as he meets local people and explores the coastline. He also learns about some of the amazing projects that are supported by Children in Need across Wales. And there's a challenge - Derek wants Pudsey to play the drums for a celebratory party on the beach at the end of the walk.
