In this special episode of Weatherman Walking, Derek Brockway is in Pembrokeshire. As he walks from St David's to Whitesands, we celebrate the amazing work done by projects and charities from around Wales that are supported by BBC Children in Need. Derek's walk is just over eight miles, it starts in St David's, the smallest city in the United Kingdom thanks to its 12th century cathedral. From here, Derek heads towards the coast, passing another spiritual site dedicated to St David's mother.
