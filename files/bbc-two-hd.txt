A pool party ruins Julia's plans before an important event at work. While Liz is at the newsagents the nice looking guy in the queue leaves his wallet behind. She takes it and hopes to return it and hopefully turn it into a date. A new Dad on the scene, who goes way back with Amanda, puts Kevin's nose out of joint.
