South African naturalist Mike Rutzen is crazy about great white sharks. He never saw `Jaws', so he doesn't share the terror that has made these sharks the world's most feared predator. For ten years Mike has been swimming with great whites, without the protection of a cage. He's spent so much time in their company that he has learnt to read their body language and to think like a shark, which helps keeps him safe.
