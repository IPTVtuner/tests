Sabrina Grant presents as a team of expert crafters transform unused objects into contemporary and functional items. Forty years ago, David and Marion bought a Swiss clock as a souvenir on their honeymoon. Its price led to their first argument, and over the years Marion has been tempted to throw it out, as it is no longer used. But they would love it to be something practical that would remind them of a special time together.
