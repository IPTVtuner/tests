The huge hits of rugby league's premier domestic competition continue as play-off rivals Wakefield Trinity and Leigh Leopards face off at Belle Vue. Wakefield have impressed on their return to Super League following promotion in 2024, and their star-studded squad equalled their record victory in this competition by scoring 13 tries in a thrashing of Salford in May 2025. Trinity take on a Leopards side who made the Super League semi-finals for the first time in 2024.
