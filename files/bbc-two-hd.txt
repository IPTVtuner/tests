Byron Bay, which sits on the easternmost point of Australia, became famous as a beacon of creativity and freedom. On her quest to better herself, Miriam is keen to see if this is still a place where anything goes, if it is changing, and if indulging in all this 'freedom' does anything for the community. Beneath the carefree exterior of the town, she learns about the issues affecting it and catches up with local influencers, hippies, and surfers.
