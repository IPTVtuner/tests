The Rugrats are in Paris where Chuckie's widowed father has been called on to mend an animated monster in a theme park, but it's all a ploy by Coco LaBouche - the park's head, to get appointed head of a major company. As she and her henchman Jean-Claude plan to ensnare him, only the rest of the Rugrats can stop him falling for her charms.
