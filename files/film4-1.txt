Plainview, Texas is a typical American small town until the Dennis gang from Kansas turn up. Robbing the bank, they kill the teller and, making their getaway, the marshal. Storekeeper Jack Wright picks up the marshal's gun and more by luck than skill shoots one of the gang. As Wright is f√©ted by the town and made marshal, gang leader Bob Dennis swears revenge and word of his return reaches the town.
