In crumbling post-war Berlin, Ivo Kern and Susanne Mallison get caught up in a maelstrom of bigamy, blackmail and bullets as Communist agents attempt to stem the flow of refugees into the West. Packed with edgy suspense, panting romance and wonderfully shady characters, the film chases through the skilfully realised tensions of the divided city towards a breathless finale.
