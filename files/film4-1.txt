A respected but ageing actor spends his time between jobs meeting up with his friends Ian and Donald for tea and gossip in the local caf√©. However, his life changes when Ian's family land him with his grand-niece Jessie, ostensibly as Ian's carer but in fact to distance her from a family crisis of her making. Maurice falls for her and takes her under his wing but what begins as a mismatched relationship, ends in a warm friendship.
