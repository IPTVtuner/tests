Joe Blake and Terry Collins are bank robbers, fugitives who are hoping that a final string of scores will finance their South of the Border retirement dream. Irresistible Joe and his hypochondriac partner Terry become `The Sleepover Bandits', the most famous thieves in the country, cutting a swath from Oregon through California and leaving terrified bankers, bad disguises and an adoring public in their wake.
