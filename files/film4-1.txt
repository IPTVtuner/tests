Running away from his home in Nottingham, Tomo ends up in London. With no money and nowhere to stay, he befriends Polish immigrant Marek, and the two spend their days getting into mischief in Somers Town, where Marek lives with his father. When Marek lets Tomo move into the family flat without his dad's consent, trouble soon brews, as the boys constantly bicker over their shared love of Maria, a local French waitress.
