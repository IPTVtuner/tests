Jacqueline Du Pr√© was acknowledged as the world's leading cellist but with the genius came a price, from intense mental stresses to unusual sexual relationships and tragically, at the end, the onset of multiple sclerosis that was to deny her even the solace of music. The film traces her life and that of her sister Hilary, and in doing so, shows a flawed genius in a love-hate relationship with her sibling.
