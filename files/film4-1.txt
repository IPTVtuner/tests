Peter Mullan made his directorial debut with this wry observation of four siblings who gather in Glasgow after their mother's death. Their meeting after many years apart brings all the problems in their lives to a head, and Mullan follows them for the 24 hours leading up to the funeral, a day that involves too much drink, a damaged Virgin Mary, a roofless church and a brawl.
