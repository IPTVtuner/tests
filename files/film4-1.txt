Based on a true story. Billy Mitchell, a WWI flying hero, is convinced America's security lies not with the navy but with a strong, separate air force. The hidebound traditionalists of the navy and army ignore him but, when one of Michell's friends is killed flying an ill-maintained plane, Mitchell's public outbursts leave them no choice but to court-martial him.
