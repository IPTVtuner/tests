Set at the end of the English Civil War, Charles I is held prisoner and Fairfax is willing to compromise over his plight while Cromwell favours execution. As conspiracies are hatched and discovered and ringleaders punished, the film faithfully follows a turbulent time in British history as two men battle for power over the country.
