Steven Spielberg's science fiction classic tells the story of an engineer who observes UFOs over Indiana and, along with hundreds of others, is drawn inexplicably to a remote mountain where scientists plan to make contact with the alien visitors. This version is the re-edited director's cut, featuring previously unseen footage.
