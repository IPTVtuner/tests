In 1950s Argentina, Ernesto Che Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado buy a clapped-out motorbike with the intention of touring South America, hitting Venezuela in time for Alberto's 30th birthday. At first, the journey is pure escapism - in one town, their pose as eminent scientists ends with them having to flee a lynch mob, but eventually what they see changes the way they think.
