A seminal film from the Ealing Studios that set out to show the work of the London police. PC George Dixon, the archetypal British bobby, is joined by a new recruit. Arriving at the scene of a domestic, Dixon is shot by Tom Riley and the film moves towards a climactic chase at the White City stadium.
