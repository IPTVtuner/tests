The sequel to `El Mariachi', the film continues the story of the no-name, solitary, brooding mariachi, whose guitar case is stocked with high-powered weaponry. The musician is in a sleepy Mexican town seeking revenge against the much-feared, ruthless Bucho, a drug dealer who once shot El Mariachi in his strumming hand, and killed his girlfriend.
