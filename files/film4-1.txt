A realistic and well-documented film re-enacting the events that led up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which plunged the United States into World War II. Boasting Oscar-winning special effects, the film gives both the Japanese and American perspectives on events, and highlights some of the major and minor errors that were made on both sides.
