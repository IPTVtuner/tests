Sequel in which nightclub singer Deloris Van Cartier is asked to get back into her habit when her old friends at St Catherine's Convent find difficulty in controlling a school filled with juvenile delinquents. Convincing everyone that Deloris is a nun is going to be a challenge in itself, especially with a group of incompetent monks trying to hinder their efforts.
