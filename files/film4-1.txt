Knockabout comedy set in the sexist world of 1970s newscasting. Ron Burgundy, San Diego's top-rated anchorman, reigns supreme in the all-male world of television news, until the arrival of an ambitious female reporter upsets the status quo. When she steps in to present the programme in Ron's absence, an uncivil war breaks out in the newsroom.
