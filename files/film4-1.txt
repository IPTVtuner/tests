Set during the uprising of the Sioux nation in the late 19th century, when broken treaties and a gold rush saw their tribal territories invaded once again. The film centres on Jim Bridger, a scout at Fort Phil Kearney, from where the 7th Cavalry rides to try and hold the peace, but the brutal slaying of innocents by a sadistic lieutenant sees the Sioux in full cry and only Bridger's cunning can help save the soldiers.
