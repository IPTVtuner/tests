Bob is annoyed when he finds out that Linda's mother is coming for a visit and wants nothing to do with it. Linda sets to work cleaning the house from top to bottom but when a leak springs up in the roof, she asks Bob's help in fixing it. Unfortunately for Bob, he gets stuck in the wall, leaving Linda and the children to entertain their guest and run the restaurant.
