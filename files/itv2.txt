This week's theme is close to all our hearts - relationships. In the sketches, Emily meets a new partner's parents, pitches long-term relationship insurance and sees an old schoolmate at the worst possible time. Her stand up explores the pitfalls of a puppy, and Emily introduces us to a new special someone in her life. Plus impressions of Gemma Collins, Lorraine and Holly Willoughby.
