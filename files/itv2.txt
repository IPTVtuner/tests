Gordon, Gino and Fred are reconvening after their European adventures to rediscover the spirit of Christmas, but much to Gordon and Fred's initial consternation, Gino's taken them to the most unlikely of places - the land of tagine, mint tea, snakes, saffron, sand dunes and camels - Morocco. Our three unwise men set off on an escapade-packed trip; this time to see what Morocco has to offer in the way of culture, cuisine and adventure.
