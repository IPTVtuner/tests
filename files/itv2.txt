The remaining six celebrities are joined by radio DJ and TV star Roman Kemp in the grand final. After five weeks singing their hearts out on stage, the stars must put their friendships aside, bring their A game, and put in one last stun-sational performance. We learn some signature dance moves, see someone perform the `heimerick remover', see the boys get their kit off, and find out who has what it takes to lift the end-of-series trophy.
