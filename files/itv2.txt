A New York couple go to an orphanage to adopt a brother for their only son, but instead come away with a little mouse. On arrival at his new home, the diminutive rodent receives a lukewarm welcome by the boy - and an even frostier reception from the pet cat. Featuring a mixture of live action and animation.
