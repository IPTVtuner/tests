Toby, an international transformation coach from Cheshire, is looking for love - three girls will be shopping for outfits for him in Sheffield's Meadowhall. Toby won't see the girls and will judge them on the outfits they choose, but will any of the clothes choice hit the mark and impress him, and who will win an indoor climbing date with him? Competing for Toby's affections are model Lucy, graphic designer Sasha, and fire performer Jenny.
