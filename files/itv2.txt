A shy songwriter moves to New York and finds love and the stardom she is seeking while working in the wild nightspot Coyote Ugly. As she attempts to get her music career off the ground, she works as a bartender. However, the raucous behaviour of her colleagues who dance on the counter while flirting outrageously with the clientele and downing copious amounts of alcohol, soon puts her relationship at risk.
