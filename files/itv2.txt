Stan is having problems with his computer at work and takes Steve to the CIA offices to fix it for him. After feeling slighted for not being CIA material, Steve is approached by the CIA's nerdy arch rivals - the NSA - who convince him to help them spy on Stan in order to bring down his father's beloved Agency.
