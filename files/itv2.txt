After four weeks on the road, Gino's airing his feet in the back seat as the guys cruise along a Texan highway. Texas is a meat lover's paradise and Gordon is keen to show the Europhiles some of the best BBQ known to man. Snow's BBQ in Lexington has two weapons they use to create mouth-watering meats: 84yr-old-pit master Miss Tootsie and the post oak she uses to infuse the gigantic ovens with wood smoke.
