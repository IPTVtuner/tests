James from Wilmslow is going to be given five menus, each of which has been put together by a potential blind date - the five women behind the menus have all come up with a three-course meal, but James will only be having dinner with three of them. He will choose his dates based on the menus he most likes the look of, but when the dinners have been eaten and the dates are done, who will he want to see for seconds?
