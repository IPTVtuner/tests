The boys are in America, and Gordon wants to show USA virgins Fred and Gino that the food and fresh produce is off the chart. First, the guys take in the Grand Canyon by helicopter before a spot of trout fishing on the Colorado River, which sees Gordon and Fred wind up in the drink. Gino cooks up a treat using their RV outdoor grill, before the chaps bed down riverside. The next day, surrounded by motorbikes, the boys find themselves caught up in a convoy on the way to Las Vegas.
