Gordon, Gino and Fred are getting together for another extraordinary culinary Christmas adventure. 2020 has been a bit bleak to say the least and the boys are keen to end the year with a bang. After Gino led them to the deserts of Morocco for last year's mis-adventure, Gordon is determined that they celebrate the season properly this time, so has arranged a boys' trip away before the madness of a family Christmas kicks in, to the ultimate winter wonderland and the official home of Santa.
