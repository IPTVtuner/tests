Scarlett Moffatt welcomes Matt to her kitchen of love. Scarlett's lined up three lovely single women - Keelie, Laureena and Aya - to each cook a three-course meal for Matt. He'll blind taste their offerings - so he doesn't know who's cooked which plate. Tasting done, Matt chooses his favourite meal before the cook behind it reveals themselves and joins him on a candlelit date. So which of Keelie, Laureena and Aya has what it takes to cook their way to a date?
