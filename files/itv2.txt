Has there been any fallout following the opening of Sam's new boutique? Will Arg and Lydia ever move in together - or will Lydia's mum Debbie or Arg himself put the brakes on? Elsewhere, Lauren's break-up proves painful, and Lothario Mark shows that he is anything but predictable when it comes to affairs of the heart.
