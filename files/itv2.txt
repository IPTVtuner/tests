Andie Anderson writes an advice column for a fashionable magazine and agrees to demonstrate how easy it is to attract then alienate a man in just ten days. She chooses Benjamin Barry, little knowing he's an advertising executive whose job rests on proving he understands women so well that he can make one fall for him in two weeks.
