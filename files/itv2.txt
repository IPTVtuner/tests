There's truly life-changing money on offer as Ant and Dec try to help more contestants climb as high up the never-ending money ladder as they can - first up are husband-and-wife team Dan and Sarah who would like to buy their first home and build an animal sanctuary for their local community, but they must cash out with enough money to fulfil their dream or else risk crashing out and leaving with nothing. It's then the turn of married couple Nik and Khajal's turn to take on the Limitless Ladder.
