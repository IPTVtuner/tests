Emily Atack hosts a no-holds-barred night of stand-up comedy, celebrity impressions and sketches. This week, sketches see a flash-mob gone wrong, Emily crashing a plane, ruining a wedding, plus a cameo from Rylan, who gets his wrists slapped by ITV's straight talking HR Officer. Meanwhile, Emily does hilariously inappropriate stand-up on the theme of old-fashioned romance.
