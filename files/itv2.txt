Having been to Mexico before to film `An Italian In Mexico', Gino thinks he can show off some culinary nous to Gordon and Fred. On a mission to taste the world's best breakfast, the boys are getting up to their old tricks when Fred is nearly floored by a 10-gallon jar of tequila filled with snakes. A hot chilli-eating competition concludes with Gino dashing to the toilet, before they hit the coast road south to go spear fishing for lunch.
