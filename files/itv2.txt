Scarlett Moffatt, Chris Hughes, The Vivienne and, in a twist, two new recruits take on the terrifying Superhuman Bosses - including multiply pierced sword-swallowers The Hungmen and record-breaking competitive eater The Belly - in a series of battles in the Torture Dome, before the weakest of them is strapped inside a Human Pinata and beaten for cash.
