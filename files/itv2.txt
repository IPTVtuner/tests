Our queens have survived to sing for another night in the Karaoke Club. Tonight's new arrival, drag king Lil Test Ease, is bringing an injection of testosterone to the party. With the semi final in sight the performers are pulling out all the stops and a surprising romance starts to blossom. Plus, the chat turns to aliens and space hoppers, as well as a revealing game of Never Have I Ever. And one of the queens gets to perform the duet of a life time with Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts.
