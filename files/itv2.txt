Mr Bean chases Scrapper around Mrs Wicket's flat but her sideboard tumbles over, and when Bean sees a bit of fur poking out from under it, he is horrified to think he has squashed poor Scrapper. Not realising that it is only his landlady's furry hat, Bean rushes what he thinks is a flattened cat across town to the vet in a desperate attempt to save his feline friend's life.
