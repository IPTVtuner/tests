This week's theme is about something we could all use - life lessons. In sketches Emily goes back to school, takes a disastrous road trip and, when she suspects her boyfriend is cheating, her Devil and Angel get the better of her. Meanwhile, Emily tells all with stand up about sex education, bunking off school, and failing her driving lessons five whole times. Plus, impressions of Stacey Solomon, Gemma Collins and Davina McCall.
