When a wardrobe malfunction occurs during a live broadcast, the FCC begins to censor all of Peter's favourite television shows. As a result Peter creates his own TV station, which broadcasts from the Griffin home. Peter and Brian create their own edgy programming for the station until the FCC shows up to shut down PTV, and censor all controversial material in Quahog.
