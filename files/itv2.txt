This week Olivia looks at a new phenomenon called The Girlfriend Experience, where men pay women for an intimate connection mentally, and sometimes physically. Olivia meets Eliza who is making Â£180k a month pretending to be a girlfriend to thousands of men online, and she travels to Paris to meet Zara who is paid to accompany men for social and physical pleasure. And will Olivia find a man who is willing to tell her why he feels the need to pay a girlfriend for their company?
