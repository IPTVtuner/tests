Having let his life become one big rut, bank worker Carl Allen gets a wake-up call when a friend introduces him to a rather novel self-improvement course. Guru Terrence Bundley has only one rule in his scheme for changing people's lives forever: say yes to everything. Reluctantly embracing the technique, Carl is soon agreeing to everything from Korean lessons to bungie jumping.
