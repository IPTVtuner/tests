In a story that replays the same day's activities from three different perspectives, Joey and Pacey vacillate on the ways to tell Dawson about their feelings for each other. When the truth does come out, Dawson's reaction is not the one they'd hoped for. Meanwhile, Andie, who thought she was getting over Pacey, sees Capeside visitor Will, but their first date is ruined when she also learns about Joey and Pacey.
