Single shoppers Wolf, Em, and Michael are hoping to win the heart of teaching assistant Kieren - they'll be picking clothes based on his instructions, but will any of them hit the mark and impress him enough to win a date with a northern twist? Kieren will have no idea who is shopping for him and have to make his choice based entirely on the clothes that they choose for him!
