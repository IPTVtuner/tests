Sequel to `Star Wars' in which Luke Skywalker undergoes Jedi training from Yoda, while romance blossoms between Han Solo and Leia. Much darker and more complex than the original film, `Empire' emphasises character revelations - including a surprise about Luke's parentage - without stinting on the action and visual effects, which won a special Oscar.
