Lister decides to read Rimmer's diary and discovers a leak from the `Stasis' (suspended-animation chamber) that creates a doorway to the past. Passing through the leak, the crew are able to go back in time to a point before the rest of the crew were wiped out and might just be able to bring someone back with them.
