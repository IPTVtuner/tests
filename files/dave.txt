Today, February 19
On your one special day, you deserve the best dish on the menu and who better to steer you in the right direction than the Hairy Bikers? Join Si King and Dave Myers as they visit three mums and discover what they hold dearest for the day of many happy returns. The lads rustle up a summer berry trifle, while our mums treat the boys to such varied dishes as a Manchester tart and greek stuffed vine leaves.
