Rick Stein reaches the mid-point of his meander through France as he continues exploring Burgundy and practices a little entente cordiale with a chateau owner who cooks him sorrel soup straight out of the garden. He then arrives in the Auvergne, famous for hearty dishes celebrating the finest Salers beef and Cantal cheese.
