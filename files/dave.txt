Today, March 13
Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May confront the credit crunch head on as they attempt to find three sensibly priced small cars that won't make you miserable, a process that involves haranguing bankers, harnessing large dogs, and almost getting arrested. Plus, James meets American stunt driving legend Ken Block, and Michael McIntyre is the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.
