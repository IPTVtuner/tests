Si and Dave lift the lid on the origins story of one of the world's favourite fast foods - Southern Fried Chicken. Richmond, Virginia is home to an African American community - many of whom are direct descendants of the 19th century agricultural slaves. Chicken was of such low status at the time that the slaves were allowed to rear their own chickens and ultimately offered them a route to freedom.
