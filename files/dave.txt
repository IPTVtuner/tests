The Yorkshire Dales provide the backdrop for an epic contest between three exquisite cars, the Jaguar XK, the BMW650i and the Mercedes SL350, and a frozen lake in Iceland is the setting for a race between a powerful rally car and a jet-powered kayak. Chef Gordon Ramsay is the Star in the Reasonably Priced Car, and Jeremy, James and Richard wreak havoc on the roads of southern England.
