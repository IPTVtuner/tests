Rick Stein joins in the ancient festival of Wassailing, tries out the famous ice rink at Eden, enjoys the company of Port Isaac's Fisherman's Friends and cooks his own goose. With Cornish Christmas music and the occasional glass of Cornish beer and cider, this festive feast is guaranteed to get viewers in the best seasonal spirits.
