While in Norfolk fishing for tench, Bob tries to impress Paul with his childhood fishing rod, and fails. They share nostalgia for their younger years and reveal how they recently came face to face with their own mortality. After a brief respite in a local brewery, they reluctantly camp down in Yurts before fishing again the next day where the elusive Tench seems to evade them until the very last minute.
