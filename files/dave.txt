Gregg Wallace follows 27 tonnes of potatoes from a farm in Hampshire through the largest crisp factory on earth, as they are peeled, sliced and fried to make more than five million packets of crisps every 24 hours. Once the crisps are flavoured, they're put into bags in one of the craziest rooms Gregg's ever seen, with over 100 machines that can fill hundreds of thousands of bags every hour.
