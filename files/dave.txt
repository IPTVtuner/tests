Today, November 11
Paul and Bob travel to the picturesque River Usk in Wales, where Paul's father first taught him to fish as a young child. Their quarry is the wild brown trout. They discuss their respective childhoods and reflect on their own family lives. In their cosy cottage accommodation in the heart of the countryside they compare school photographs and Paul serenades Bob with his guitar.
