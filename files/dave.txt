Rick Stein heads east from Oaxaca to the Yucatan Peninsula, a place once frequented by real pirates of the Caribbean, including Sir Francis Drake. Here, where the Europeans first landed over five hundred years ago, the local folk have lighter skins and blue or green eyes. They feast on the hottest chilli of them all, the habanero, and give slow food a new meaning as they bury and cook their Pibil dishes below ground on hot rocks.
