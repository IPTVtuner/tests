Today, October 28
In Hay on Wye, Paul and Bob fish for the mighty barbel. Passing a graveyard they muse about the future and chat to a local vicar about death and their own funerals.To lighten the mood, back in their wooden fishing cabin, Bob promises Paul a very special treat if they are successful in their angling efforts.
