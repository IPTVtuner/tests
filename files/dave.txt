Gregg Wallace joins a human production line in the largest sports shoe factory in the UK to see how they produce three and a half thousand pairs of trainers every 24 hours by sewing 32 million individual stitches and using 140 miles of thread. He'll make his own pair of shoes and discover how they put together 27 different pieces made from 8 different materials which require auto and manual stitching and finishing with a roughening robot and a hot oven.
