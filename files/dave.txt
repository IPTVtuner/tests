Jeremy sets out to compare the current Mercedes SL with the same model from 1972, and does the same with the modern-day Audi TT V6 and Ford's classic Capri V6. How do they fare? Other features include the latest Nissan Micra, a saloon car speed record attempt in Germany, plus Johnny Vegas as the celebrity guest.
