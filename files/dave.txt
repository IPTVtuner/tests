Comedians Rhod Gilbert and Greg Davies attempt to drive through the mountainous, landlocked nation of Nepal. Starting from the chaotic border with India, they travel across the country's most important roads, from highways that maintain its cities to freshly-dug dirt tracks that connect to isolated communities. There are uplifting stories throughout, but it is a journey that is fraught with danger.
