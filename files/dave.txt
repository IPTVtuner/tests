Rick Stein travels to St Ives to meet one of Britain's little-known artists, Alfred Wallis. In the shadow of Bodmin Moor Rick visits a very rare collection of medieval stained-glass windows in the church of St Neot. It is here he ticks off an item on his bucket list by taking part in a rather unusual celebration called Oak Apple Day, marking the occasion when Charles II became king.
