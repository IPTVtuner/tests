Today, March 21
Dave and Si explore Britain's world-class beef. Known as `le rosbif' to our continental neighbours, the Bikers celebrate this nickname with a beef and suet pudding and oxtail soup. They visit a farmer focusing on the future of British beef with his elite wagyu cattle, discover the history of the much maligned beef dish, tripe, as well as learning how to roast an ox whole.
