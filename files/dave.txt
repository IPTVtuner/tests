Today, February 16
The Hairy Bikers are treated to flamboyant recipes that would be fit for a king. Si King and Dave Myers sample such delights as a pig's trotter dish from the Baltics and a lemon souffle by order of the royal family. They learn the secret behind a perfect baked Alaska and conjure up their own prized honey glazed ham. The lads are also shown a lesson or two in etiquette.
