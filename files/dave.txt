Today, July 14
In this episode, he learns about the local speciality of Sardinia, roasted suckling pig, and hosts a traditional Italian festa for his closest island friends. He then sets off across the north of the island, visiting Alghero, a medieval walled town on the north-west coast. He experiences its Spanish-influenced architecture and - of course - the food. Gino ends his visit with a 20-minute boat trip across the bay to a cave network.
