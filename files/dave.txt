Gino D'Acampo visits the town of Orgosolo, made famous by the abundance of murals depicting its proud history. He then meets a shepherd who explains how the simple food from the land sustains the Sardi people, before visiting a distillery that still brews Sardinian moonshine where he gets more than he bargained for after tasting the fiery tipple. Finally, Gino whips up a hearty rustic pasta dish, using traditional but simple ingredients, and serves it to his new-found friends.
