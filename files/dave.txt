When Lee's feckless dad, Frank, announces that he's engaged to be married, Lee cannot believe that any woman would want to marry him. There must be something wrong with her. Lucy invites Frank and Carol to dinner to allay Lee's fears. Carol turns out to be perfect, but now Lee is even more nervous. Frank seems to dote on her. If Carol dumps Frank, Frank will be devastated.
