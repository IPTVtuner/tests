James explores the wilder shores of motoring to discover what happened to the cars of the future that we were promised. From improbable steam cars and ludicrous jet turbines he reveals how the petrol engine and the power it gave us came to dominate the 20th century. He'll take to the waves in an amphibious car, risk his life at the wheel of a notorious electric scooter and take a hair raising trip in the fastest driverless car on earth.
