In the season one closer, the guys give awards for Car of the Year, Most Pointless Car, and Weirdest Renault; among others. Reviews are given of the Toyota Land Cruiser, BMW X5, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and Range Rover. Clarkson fondly remembers the Lotus Esprit, Dawe looks at a number of car bargains, and there is a second attempt to find the `Fastest Faith'.
