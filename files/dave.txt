Hugh Bonneville and Jessica Hynes pair up for a terrifying road trip through the former Russian state of Georgia. Whilst the country and its people delight and surprise them at every turn, the drive itself is a challenge all the way. As they travel from the Azerbaijani border to the Black Sea, Jessica's spirit of adventure causes the more reserved Hugh more than a few moments of anxiety.
