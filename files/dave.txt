Today, March 13
The Bikers celebrate the great British marketplace and the delicious food we get from it. In the kitchen, Dave and Si make the most of the market fudge stall with a rich walnut and fudge cake and prepare two seasonal soups. They also travel to Britain's foodie heartland in Ludlow to peruse the market stalls at the food festival and discuss the impact the supermarket has had on the food we eat.
