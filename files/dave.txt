Robson Green fetches up in the blue waters of the Philippines, where fishing is an essential part of the lifestyle. He sets out to land a highly intelligent dorado fish, before catching and eating jellyfish. Elsewhere, Robson sees the devastating effects of dynamite fishing and is left to fend for himself overnight on a tropical island.
