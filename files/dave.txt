Dave and Si look across the Channel to see how our French cousins have influenced the way we cook and eat over the centuries. The Bikers prepare a delicious roast chicken with forty cloves of garlic and a delicate mille feuille, they also show us that Britain is now leading the way in many traditional `French' areas for gastronomy, from award winning English wines to outstanding Scottish garlic.
