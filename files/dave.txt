Continuing his journey from Venice to Istanbul, Rick Stein arrives in the Greek Peloponnese and samples memorable dishes like rooster stew hilopites with mizithra cheese and the best home-made moussaka he's ever had. In his Symi island kitchen he cooks galaktoboureko, Greece's all-time favourite dessert.
