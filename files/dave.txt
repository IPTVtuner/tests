The presenters compete in an epic race across London: Jeremy in a speed boat, James in a car, Richard on his push bike and the Stig on public transport. Richard races the new Aston Martin V8 Vantage convertible against a jet powered roller skater and Jeremy track tests the incredibly fast Caparo T1 road racer. The star in a reasonably priced car is Simon Cowell.
