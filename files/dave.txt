Dave
Today, March 14
Dave and Si celebrate the British love-affair with pigs and pork, perhaps the animal which has given more to British food culture than any other. They prepare a traditional gala pie and a sumptuous rolled pork loin with apricots and ginger. They also explain the important role the family pig has played in our history and travel to Butts Farm in Gloucestershire.
