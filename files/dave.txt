Today, March 28
Dave and Si focus on British sheep, which have provided us with milk, meat and wool for thousands of years. In the kitchen, they rustle up a classic hogget and barley stew and tender lamb chops with kidneys. They also help cook and eat a mouth-watering dish brought from North Africa called mechoui lamb, and reveal the history of the hardy seaweed-eating sheep found on the island of North Ronaldsay.
