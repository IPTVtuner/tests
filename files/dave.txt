Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May immerse themselves in the world of classic cars to find out if they really are more fun than modern machinery. Armed with a budget of Â£3,000 each, they attempt to buy a pre-1982 car at auction. The trio are then sent to Majorca to take part in a classic car rally. Also in the show, Jeremy drives with dinosaurs in the new BMW Z4 and Nissan 370Z.
