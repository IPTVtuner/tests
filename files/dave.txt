Clarkson reviews the Nissan GT-R and tests it out on the Fuji Speedway and James takes a look at the Renault Megane Coupé Concept. Two classic limousines are compared; Clarkson's 1969 Grosser Mercedes-Benz and May's 1972 Rolls Royce Corniche Coupé. Judges from `Dragon's Den' Peter Jones and Theo Paphetis are the Stars in a Reasonably Priced Car.
