Jeremy, Richard and James face their greatest challenge to date as all three are sent to Africa and each told to buy a second-hand car costing no more than Â£1,500. It must not be a 4x4 and must not be designed in any way to go off-road. Which could be a problem, since their task is then to drive across the wilds of Botswana, negotiating massive salt pans, treacherous rivers and animal reserves.
