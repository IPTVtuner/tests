Comedians Hugh Dennis and David Baddiel drive over 2000km of Ethiopia's bone shaking roads in a quest to reach Aksum, known as the home of the Ark of the Covenant. Along the way they have to compete with truck drivers high on local drug khat, a calamitous breakdown and a shortage of fuel in the middle of the night.
