Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May engage in an epic race from Wembley to the San Siro stadium in Milan. Hamstrung by a rule about price, Clarkson maximises his bang-for-buck with a Â£35,000, 662 horsepower Shelby Mustang GT500, while Hammond and May pin their hopes to the ever-improving pan-European rail network.
