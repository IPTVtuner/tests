Today, April 29
Dave and Si revisit the 1970s, a decade which is all too often unfairly stigmatised for its food. They show how a well prepared chicken cordon bleu and banoffee pie can be a contemporary gastronomic delight, before heading to a restaurant whose menu is a real slice of the 1970s as well as celebrating a decade which gave us both the self-sufficiency movement and instant food.
