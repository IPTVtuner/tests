Paul and Bob fish the beautiful river Wensum in search of the equally beautifully Roach. Struggling up and down the riverbanks, they realise how age is starting to take its toll on their physicality. But Bob has a plan to help Paul recapture his youth.They stay overnight in a disused train station and visit the local pub with Paul showing off his new look, courtesy of Bob.
