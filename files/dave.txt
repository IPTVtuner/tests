Robson heads to Thailand to sample the delights of Bangkok's infamous fish market, before attempting to land the fast and feisty arapaima. Elsewhere, Robson pays a visit to the River Kwai, learns traditional fishing techniques, and spends a night on a raft in the middle of a lake. He rounds off his trip with an attempt to catch the biggest freshwater fish of his entire fishing career - a stingray.
