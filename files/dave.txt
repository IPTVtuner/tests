Gregg Wallace explores the Grimsby factory that processes 165 tonnes of fish a week, and produces 80,000 cod fish fingers every day. Cod arrives at the factory as compressed blocks of frozen fish. The blocks weigh exactly 7.484 kilos, which is a standardised measure in every fish factory right across the world.
