Following in Stephen Fry's footsteps, `IT Crowd' actor Richard Ayoade takes over as the `Gadget Man' beginning with the programme's second series. The technology fan introduces viewers to the latest products in the consumer electronics industry and other types of technological innovations, trying out whatever he can get his hands on - even prototypes . `Gadget Man' also features Ayoade designing his own problem-solving contraptions he hopes will help people in the future.
