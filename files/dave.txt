Today, March 11
Dave and Si reveal the British obsession with apples, as well as the slightly smaller passion for pears. They combine two of Britain's greatest ingredients in a beef and apple tagine, before creating a sumptuous pear frangipane tart. They also visit a heritage orchard sampling some of the 2,000 apple varieties in the UK and explore the history of Wassailing.
