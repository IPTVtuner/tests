Today, March 02
It is Bank Holiday Monday, and the Essex contingent arrives for a sunny day out at the beach; even Doris gets her sun dress on. Gavin's heart-to-heart with his dad gives him something more to think about, and a dark cloud looms on the horizon when Dave arrives to find Nessa and Smithy enjoying all the fun of the fair.
