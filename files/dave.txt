Gregg Wallace helps to unload 27 tonnes of dried haricot beans from North America and follows them on a one and a half mile journey through the largest baked bean factory in the world which makes more 3 million cans of beans every 24 hours. He'll discover how a laser scrutinises every single bean; how the spice recipe for the sauce is a classified secret known only by two people; and, most surprisingly, how the beans are cooked in the can in a room of giant pressure cookers - not baked at all!
