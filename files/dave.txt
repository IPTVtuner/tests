aul and Bob return to Scotland to fish for salmon once more, this time on the mighty River Tweed. They start their search for a so-called bar of silver surrounded by banks of lush tall trees at the Bemersyde Estate, a place where it is easy to forget the outside world and do nothing but concentrate on fishing.
