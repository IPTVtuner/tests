Paul and Bob decide to try and catch a legendary Pike, which is perhaps not the best idea for two men of a certain age with heart problems. In the cosy cottage where they are staying, they invite a consultant cardiologist for dinner to talk about their medical past and their future, gaining tips on how to live the most healthy life possible. Facing the future, they write a eulogy for each other as the sun sets on their final fishing expedition.
