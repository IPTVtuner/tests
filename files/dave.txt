Gordon ends his Indian food adventure by travelling south to Kerala for the ultimate seafood curry. Later, in Tamil Nadu, he tries bullock racing and also faces his biggest culinary nightmare: living in an ashram where the only food on the menu is vegetarian. The last stop finds Gordon in Mumbai where he samples street food in Asia's largest slum and, later, cooks alongside one of India's top chefs, Hermant Oberoi.
