Today, May 23
There was a time when the British pub was pretty much a male-only establishment and food, at best, was a bowl of nuts and some pork scratchings. Today, most British pubs depend on the income from food and some dishes have become pub classics. Dave and Si explore the history behind the boom in pub food and recreate mouthwatering dishes that would make any publican proud.
