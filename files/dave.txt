Funny men Phill Jupitus and Marcus Brigstocke head to Bolivia for a high-altitude road trip. Already good friends, the terrified duo first have to survive Bolivia's infamous Road of Death only to find themselves deep in notorious bandit country. Disorientation takes them by surprise as they have to navigate the stunning Salar de Uyuni, a salt lake so vast that Buzz Aldrin could see it from space.
