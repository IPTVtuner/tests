Susanna Reid gains exclusive access to police evidence from the investigation into one of Britain's most notorious serial killers, Joanne Dennehy, who murdered three men on a killing spree. Over two weeks in 2013, 30-year-old Dennehy murdered three men and attempted to kill two others. At trial, she showed no remorse for her victims, and became one of only three British women ever to be sentenced to spend the rest of her life behind bars.
