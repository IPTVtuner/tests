This is the story of two young men whose paths tragically crossed on September 29, 1998 in Houston, Texas. One was a sheriff's deputy while the other, like his father, stayed on the wrong side of the law. The deputy made a routine traffic stop one night that ended with him being brutally shot to death by the other young man, Michael Lopez.
