Real Crime
Today, January 25
A morally complex post-colonial tragedy, the story of a murder and of Fiji, a small country divided along ethnic and class lines, told through the eyes of two very different families. Director of the Fiji Red Cross John Scott and his partner of 20 years, Greg Scrivener were brutally murdered in the name of God by a young indigenous man, Apete Kaisau.
