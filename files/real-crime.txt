A robbery and double homicide at a grocery store in Raleigh, North Carolina shocks the community. With little evidence left behind, and no eyewitnesses, the investigation stalls. Then a tip to authorities implicates a store employee in another robbery and leads Prosecutor Evelyn Hill to believe that that employee, and his brother, committed the murders.
