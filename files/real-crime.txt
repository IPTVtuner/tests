Real Crime
Today, June 14
18 April 1993, and one of the most notorious religious leaders in the United States, David Koresh, along with 83 of his followers, has been trapped inside a Waco, Texas, compound for over 50 days, unwilling to surrender and surrounded by the police authorities. The siege is the longest modern-day standoff in American law enforcement history. In 24 hours, however, it will all be over, and Koresh and 73 others will be dead.
