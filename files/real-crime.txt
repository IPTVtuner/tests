Real Crime
Today, May 18
Lone Witness is the story of Buffalo, New York gang leader Donald Sly Green and a lone witness to a gangland slaying which helped bring Green to justice. By the fall of 1988, the east side of Buffalo was rapidly becoming a war zone. There was little that authorities could do. Green's murder of a rival in broad daylight was just another in a string of gang-related killings.
