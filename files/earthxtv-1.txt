Ian and Henry kick off with their version of the classic Chinese crispy duck pancakes, and follow it up with an American favourite, spicy cauliflower wings with ranch sauce. Their old friend Luke Robinson calls in to make a dish of miso-glazed aubergine. Next, Henry and Ian use the very best winter vegetables in their hearty herby stew, and finish with a show-stopping sweet treat: their pain au choco-cake.
