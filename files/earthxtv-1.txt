Ian and Henry serve up a comforting dish of pastaball marinara - their take on meatballs in tomato sauce. Next up, is baked banana French toast, topped off with a juicy, warm, berry compote, a healthier way to start your day. Chef Meriel Armitage stops by and cooks her signature BBQ glazed jackfruit ribs, while the boys demonstrate their answer to a Chinese takeaway with crispy chilli tofu and special fried rice.
