Henry plates up a taste of Spain with his dad's paella. For the sweet-toothed the boys bake the afternoon tea classic: Victoria sponge. Day Radley, head chef at the Vegan Chef School, treats the boys to her colourful beetroot ravioli and slaw. Henry and Ian's snack hacks focus on how to jazz up homemade houmous, and they make a Texan-style pizza with smoky, spiced tofu and tasty bourbon sauce.
