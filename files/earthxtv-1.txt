Ian and Henry kick off with their take on a classic fish pie: their creamy seaside pie. Next, they bring a taste of Mexico to the kitchen with chilli and nachos, the perfect snack for a night in. Rachel Ama drops by to cook her harissa hotpot, gorgeous aubergine cooked in a hot and spicy sauce, then the boys serve up their big burrito cake, filled with all kinds of goodies: sweet potatoes, smoky peppers and spicy rice.
