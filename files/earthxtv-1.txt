Dr Neil Burnie and his Ocean Vet team set out to save, protect, and learn more about Bermuda's incredible marine life. Witness Neil and his team working with some of the planet's most amazing marine species. From swimming and satellite tagging huge tiger sharks, saving precious turtles, protecting mighty humpback whales, to exploring the anatomy of one of the fastest fish in the ocean-the giant blue marlin. It's all just another day in the office for the Ocean Vet team.
