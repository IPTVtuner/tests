Henry and Ian serve up delicious Asian flavours with their Thai `no fish' cakes and demonstrate how to transform meat-free sausages into smoky chorizo for a sensational piri piri tray bake. Michelin-starred chef Alexis Gauthier visits the kitchen to show how he's transformed a classic French pate into a vegan `faux gras'. There's some healthy `snack hack' smoothies and, for dessert, spectacular no-egg mini banoffee meringues with cashew cream and caramel sauce.
