Quest +1
Today, October 03
Paramedic Kirsten responds to an unusual call from the police: a burglar has injured himself while trying to escape from a house he was burgling. As Kirsten arrives to support the crews already at scene, she finds he is in agony with a nasty open fracture to his leg. The teams also attend to a pregnant woman who may be in early labour, a patient suffering an episode of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), a child hit by a car, and a person who has been hit by a train.
