Quest +1
Today, December 04
Sarah Moore is at Witley Recycling Centre in search of tired and unwanted items she can transform from skip-bound to stylish. With three items saved, Sarah turns to design duo Josh and Oli to re-purpose an old mower, while upholsterer Leigh-Anne Treadwell goes out on a limb with her redesign of a pair of teak chairs. Sarah's own challenge is to find new homes for three Persian rugs.
