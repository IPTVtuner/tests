We follow ambulance crews in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Paisley and also spend time with the special operations response teams as they deal with the most serious emergencies. In Aberdeen, ambulance crew Sarah and Stuart are called to a patient with epilepsy who has suffered a succession of fits and needs to be taken to hospital. In Edinburgh, the special operations team attend a car crash involving some tourists who have just arrived in Scotland.
