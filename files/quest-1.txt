Quest +1
Today, January 19
Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First, metal maestro Dominic Chinea faces an epic challenge when Liz Draper from Dorset delivers a crumbling, cast-iron garden gate. The gate was designed and built by her brother as a gift for Liz and her late husband, Ken. Ken was an army man and proud member of the Royal Lancers, and the gate's design incorporates his regiment's badge.
