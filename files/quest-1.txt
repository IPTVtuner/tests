Quest +1
Today, November 03
Today in the Repair Shop, Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First to arrive is a delicately carved set of clay sculptures, for the attention of ceramics expert Kirsten Ramsey. Owner Jackie treasures the figurines, lovingly crafted by her older brother Andrew who tragically died in an accident at the tender age of 18. After over 40 years on display, the unglazed figurines are crumbling and in dire need of repair.
