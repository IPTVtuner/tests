Today, October 22
Iconic pop star Boy George grew up in south London in an Irish family, and expects to find a lot of sadness in his family tree. His maternal grandmother was found wandering the streets of Dublin as a small child and was put in a children's home, and he wants to find out how she came to be in such a dire situation. He has also heard that another ancestor was hanged in Dublin's Mountjoy Gaol and is somehow connected to Kevin Barry who was commemorated in a well-known Irish rebel song.
