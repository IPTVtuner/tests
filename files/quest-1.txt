Quest +1
Today, April 19
Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Mechanical maestro Steve Fletcher and metal man Dominic Chinea tackle the motor and body of a hand-made toy racing car. The unique vehicle serves as a memento of a brave father from Poland who, as a boy during the war, was forced to work in a munitions factory's iron foundry. Eventually, with the help of the French resistance, he managed to escape.
