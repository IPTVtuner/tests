Quest +1
Today, September 15
Toy restorers Julie and Amanda welcome a stuffed monkey called Midge into the barn. Owner Charles received the toy primate as a Christmas present in the 1960s, but when he turned 14, his market trader dad put Midge to work on his Barnsley Market stall. To attract shoppers, the monkey hung from the stall whilst an invisible pulley waved his hand.
