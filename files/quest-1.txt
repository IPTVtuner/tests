Quest +1
Today, March 01
It's another night shift for Ambulance crews in Lancashire, and 999 calls are coming in at a rate of one every 15 seconds. A call concerning a 100-year-old patient causes concern for crewmates Holly and Isaac. They can see that the patient is lying on the floor, but they can't get in and will have to wait for the fire brigade to come and gain entry to the house. Once inside, they learn that all isn't as it first seemed.
