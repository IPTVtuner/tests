Quest +1
Today, April 27
Andrew Denly and his wife Sheila are hoping clockmaker Steve Fletcher can fix a vintage boy's toy with big memories attached. The antique toy cannon was handed down to Andrew from his grandfather, who bought it with his pocket money in 1907. Andrew's grandfather was his boyhood hero, and his little cannon much treasured, though it hasn't fired a shot for over 50 years.
