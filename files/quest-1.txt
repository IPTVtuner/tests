Quest +1
Today, February 16
Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First up are sisters Daisy and Indiana Perry with their father's damaged motor bike saddle bags. They are here to entrust them with leather restoration expert Susie Fletcher. Their father, Mark, is a devoted biker and the bags have accompanied him on the open road for tens of thousands of miles.
