Quest +1
Today, December 20
Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First through the barn doors is a small, wooden child's chair gifted to a boy with cystic fibrosis. Sam was diagnosed as a toddler and passed away aged 39. Now his father Ian hopes furniture restorer Will Kirk can revive the broken childhood chair to pass on to Sam's young son who has never seen it in one piece.
