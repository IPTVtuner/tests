Today, September 15
After a successful day of salvaging at the recycling centre in Woking, upcycling expert Sarah Moore hopes to generate profits from three hidden gems saved from the skip. To help her on her way, Sarah turns to blacksmith Kev Paxton to come up with a creative new use for some metal ladders, while upholsterer Simion Hawtin-Smith tackles a small armchair. Sarah takes on the ambitious project of restyling a bed frame, but will all her hard work pay off?
