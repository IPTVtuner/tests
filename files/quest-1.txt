Quest +1
Today, March 28
A teenager is one of a group of students flying off to Paris. Before take-off, he has a premonition of disaster and is ejected, along with five other students and a teacher, from the flight. Sure enough, the plane explodes, but death hates to be cheated and only Alex's intuitive powers can save the dwindling band of survivors.
