Quest +1
Today, April 29
Jay Blades and the team bring three treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. Loona Hazarika from London is first to arrive with an Indian dancing doll that he'd love ceramics expert Kirsten Ramsay and clockwork king Steve Fletcher to work on. The figurine comes in four fragile pieces connected together with wires, when touched she gives a little wiggle.
