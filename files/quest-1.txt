Quest +1
Today, February 23
One year on from the beginning of national lockdown, crews book on across Lancashire for another night shift. A 999 call is received from a distressed wife saying her husband is in cardiac arrest. Ruth and Sarah are immediately dispatched and find that the patient is awake but refusing to go to hospital, much to his wife's dismay. The shift takes a dramatic turn when a 999 call is received from a frantic caller. A man has been stabbed and urgently needs help.
