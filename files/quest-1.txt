There is a big project for guitar expert Julyan Wallis: a 1960s guitar that belonged to Robyn Griffith's grandfather, who had a real love of jazz but never had the opportunity to learn to play this cherished instrument. Robyn has inherited not just the guitar but a talent for playing, and he would love to enjoy it.
