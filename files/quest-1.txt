Quest +1
Today, February 16
It is the anniversary of the government's announcement of a national lockdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic, and Lancashire paramedic Chris reflects on whether northerners have dealt with difficult times in different ways in the past year. As the team in control settle in for the next 12 hours, Chris and Lee are immediately dispatched to a patient who has fallen from a horse in a remote rural location. With limited helicopter resources available across the region and another 999 call in progress for a patient who is trapped underneath a mobile home, they realise support for their patient is looking unlikely. But despite suffering a nasty injury, the patient is unfazed and seems more concerned about how his horse might be feeling after the accident. Later, Chris and Lee are dispatched to a patient who is feeling suicidal.
