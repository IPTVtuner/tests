Will continues his tour around Wales by moving to both mid-Wales and the west of the country. From a lead mine that's thousands of years old and a beautiful cave with a very scary entry to an abandoned sea fort and a derelict mental asylum, Will uncovers historical gems that reveal parts of the middle and west of Wales that you never knew existed.
