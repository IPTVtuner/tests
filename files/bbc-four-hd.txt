The long-running music programme truly enters the 1980s with balloons, flags and an ever-expanding party atmosphere. 1982 marks the peak of British 'new pop' as Wham, ABC and Culture Club make sensational debuts, Shalamar's Jeffrey Daniel premieres the moonwalk on British TV and Dexy's new Irish sound tops the summer charts for four weeks with Come on Eileen.
