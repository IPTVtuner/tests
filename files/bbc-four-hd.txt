Live (almost) from London's iconic Palladium theatre, the nation's favourite comedy star, Dawn French, is about to reveal (almost) all the most excruciating gaffes and howlers she's made across her 40-year career as a comedian and actress. Dawn likes a laugh, and she likes it best of all when the laugh is on her. Her new one-woman show is more than just stand-up.
