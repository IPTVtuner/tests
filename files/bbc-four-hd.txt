When Lee Miller returned to New York from Europe in October 1932, newspaper reporters were waiting to greet her as her ship docked. Disembarking in a smart beret and fur-collared coat, she smiled for the journalist from the New York World-Telegram. When he referred to her as `one of the most photographed girls in Manhattan', she retorted, `I'd rather take a picture than be one.' Lee Miller is one of the most remarkable female icons of the 20th century.
