As the 80s decade comes to a close, the `Top of the Pops' vaults open once more to offer up the movers, shakers and chart toppers of 1989. This compilation looks back and rejoices in performances from grown ups Tina Turner and Phil Collins, all-conquering funki dredds Soul II Soul, dance queen Paula Abdul, northern soul girl Lisa Stansfield and the stubborn indie pop of The Beautiful South.
