Today, December 06
As the BBC makes its exit from the iconic West London site of Television Centre, this is a special night of celebration of the building and its 53-year history. To kick start proceedings, the nation's favourite nutty boys and national treasures Madness take to the stage at the front of BBC Television Centre to perform an hour long concert in front of an assembled audience.
