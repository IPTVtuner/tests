London 1864. On a Hackney bound train, a guard discovers blood in a first class carriage - and a body on the railway embankment. For the first time, a murder has taken place on Britain's railways. Over a hundred years later, this documentary uses the first hand testimony of the people involved at the time to explore this unique event and how it provoked a huge public outcry and debate.
