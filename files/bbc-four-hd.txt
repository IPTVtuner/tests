Philip Glenister fires up the Quatro one more time and takes a trip back in time to reflect on the hugely popular seventies-set drama series Life on Mars, with writer and creator Matthew Graham joining him for the ride. Together they discuss the challenges of recreating the 70s, analyse why Life on Mars seemed to grab the public's imagination from the very beginning and share their memories of creating and playing one of television's greatest unreconstructed hard men.
