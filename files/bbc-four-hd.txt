In nature, living long enough to breed is a monumental struggle, and many animals and plants go to extremes to give themselves a chance. Three brother cheetahs band together to bring down a huge ostrich, bottle-nosed dolphins trap fish in a ring of mud, the strawberry frog carries a tadpole high into a tree and drops it in a water-filled bromeliad, and chinstrap penguins undertake a journey through the broken ice to get out to sea.
