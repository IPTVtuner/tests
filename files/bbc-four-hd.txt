Jim encounters ever larger cosmic structures to reveal the latest breakthroughs in understanding of the universe. For example, there's the heliosphere, a vast cloud of solar plasma that surrounds and protects the solar system. Its unique physics help people understand why life is possible. Larger still, Jim comes face to face with our galactic home the Milky Way, a monstrous structure sculpted by the gravitational forces of dark matter.
