In this special episode to mark the end of another season of The Sky at Night, we team up with Radio 4's The Infinite Monkey Cage to talk all things amateur astronomy. Join Maggie, Chris and Pete, alongside Professor Brian Cox and comedians Robin Ince and Dara Ã“ Briain, in front of a live audience at the BBC's Radio Theatre. Together they discuss their love of stargazing and share their top tips and favourite kit for looking up at the night sky.
