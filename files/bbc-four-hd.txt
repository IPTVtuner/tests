With access to the Paris 2024 organising committee, French film-makers Jules and Gedeon Naudet document the behind-the-scenes preparation for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The cameras track not only committee president Tony Estanguet, but also the technicians, athletes, engineers, officials, security details, volunteers and creatives as they prepare to host 28 days of competition in front of millions of spectators and billions of television viewers.
