A stunning look at how mammals dominate the planet through intelligence, having warm blood, and the care they lavish on their young. A mother Weddell seal wears her teeth down keeping open a hole in the ice so she can catch fish for her pup, cameras follow the migration of millions of bats in Zambia and thousands of caribou across the Arctic tundra, while male humpback whales are shown battling for a female.
