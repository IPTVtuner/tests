An incredible look at insects and how their armoured covering allowed them to become the most successful animal group ever. The camera flies with millions of monarch butterflies, while super slow motion shows a bombardier beetle firing boiling liquid at enemies through a rotating nozzle. Later, a honey bee army is seen stinging a raiding bear into submission, and a complex colony of grass cutter ants is seen like never before.
