The Orchestra of the Royal Opera House presents this production of Poulenc's short opera `La Voix Humaine'. Originally based on Jean Cocteau's 1928 play, it examines the change that the technology of the telephone was to bring to humans and how they conducted their relationships. Featuring only a single character, the woman known only as Elle, it has been regarded as a career-defining challenge it has attracted many actresses and singers since it was premiered.
