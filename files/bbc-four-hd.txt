Simon Schama argues that it is impossible to understand how Shakespeare came to belong `to all time' without understanding just how much he was of his time. Simon explores Shakespeare's attitude to the other great subject of his day - kingship. He looks at the ways in which Shakespeare's most profound tragedies - `Richard II', `Hamlet', `Macbeth', and `King Lear' - may have been inspired by his own experiences.
