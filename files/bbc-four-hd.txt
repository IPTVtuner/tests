The picture-perfect setting of Cumbria's Dentdale is the location for Lemn Sissay's breathtaking journey into a world of snow-capped hills, blue skies and birdsong. Starting high on the moorlands above Dent village, and carrying a 360-degree camera, Lemn walks along ancient drovers' roads and the old postman's path, with breathtaking winter views in every direction. Meeting locals, including a farmer who collects vintage tractors and a lone bagpiper, Lemn is inspired.
