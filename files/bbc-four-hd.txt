Acclaimed observational documentary by BAFTA award winning director Molly Dineen set at London's Angel tube station in 1989, three years before its desperately needed renovation. The programme provides a humorous account of 48 hours in the life of the tube station, from the daily round of fraught commuters, overburdened lifts and cancelled trains to the nightly activities when 'fluffers', women who clean human hair and rubbish off the tracks to avoid a fire hazard.
