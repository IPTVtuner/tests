The groundbreaking director, photographer and artist Sir Horace Ové, who died earlier this year aged 86, was best known for his unique work exploring Britain's black culture, using drama and documentary to examine a section of society that was largely overlooked by the mainstream media. A true pioneer, here Horace's life and career is remembered by his actor daughter Indra Ové, in a conversation that outlines his commitment to story-telling, as seen in his acclaimed 1979 film A Hole in Babylon.
