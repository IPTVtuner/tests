Jools presents a look back at some archive treats from some of the stars of reggae and ska music, including reggae greats such as Gregory Isaacs in 1995 and Jimmy Cliff in 2008, and some of the joyous performances from the Annual Hootenanny, with the likes of Desmond Dekker and his big hit 'Israelites' to Dawn Penn and Lee Thompson and not forgetting the inimitable Amy Winehouse who shared her love for the genre with a rendition of a Toots and the Maytals song.
