Hitler stages a grand celebration at Nuremberg while Germany becomes increasingly isolated abroad. Political opposition is outlawed, and an incensed Göring takes the stand at the Reichstag fire trial. As the year ends, US Ambassador William E Dodd visits a Hitler 'itching for conflict'. Berlin stands a stark contrast to its former self 12 months ago, in the thrall of one political party, one ideology and one Führer.
