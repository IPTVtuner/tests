Writer Sally Wainwright looks back on the origins of her Bafta-winning drama Happy Valley, which first appeared on the nation's TV screens in 2014, and instantly established itself as one of the great television experiences of recent years. With a cast led by Sarah Lancashire, James Norton and Siobhan Finneran, it was a case of characters, crime and countryside all combining beautifully to create unmissable television, that has continued to hook millions of viewers.
