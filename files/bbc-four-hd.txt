An incredible look at birds reveals some of the extraordinary things that having feathers allows them to do. For the first time, a slow-motion camera captures the unique flight of the marvellous spatuletail hummingbird, and aerial photography takes us into the sky with an Ethiopian lammergeier. Also featured are the spectacular massed gathering of pink flamingoes, and the comic mating display of the sage grouse.
