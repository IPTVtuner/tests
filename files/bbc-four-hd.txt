The extraordinary story of how the 19-year-old Mary Shelley created `Frankenstein', one of the world's most terrifying monsters. Daughter of Mary Woolstencraft, wife of Percy Byshe Shelley and close friend to Lord Byron, Mary Shelley's life was every bit as extraordinary as her most famous work. Using dramatisation, the film shows how her monstrous creation reflected her own extraordinary experiences.
