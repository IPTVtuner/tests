With the release of their new album `Spirit', Depeche Mode return to the stage for BBC Radio 6 Music Festival, before they embark on a world tour. Depeche Mode, who formed in 1980 in Basildon, Essex, have not played at the 2,000-capacity Barrowland Ballroom in Glasgow for more than 30 years, when they performed as part of their Some Great Reward tour. Now, back at the historic Barrowland, their amazing return as part of 6 Music Festival is captured.
