Professor Alice Roberts joins the team excavating a 3,000 year-old Bronze Age village in the Cambridgeshire Fens that's been called the 'British Pompeii'. The village earned its nickname because, 3,000 years ago, it burned to the ground - as it burned, it fell into the peat, preserving both the houses and their contents. Until its discovery, we had little real idea of what life was like in Bronze Age Britain.
