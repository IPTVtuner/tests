A musical mystery awaits at the Royal Albert Hall as Scotland's premiere baroque ensemble, the Dunedin Consort, led by John Butt, unveil the musical inspiration behind Mozart's Great Mass in C minor, a colossus of the choral repertoire. The revered work comprises the entire second half of the concert, while audiences are first treated to a series of shorter pieces by JS Bach and CPE Bach, two men who inspired Mozart in the creation of his mighty Mass.
