A Storyville documentary in which ultra-Orthodox Jewish couples speak bravely about their feelings during matchmaking, the engagement period, the wedding ceremony, their first night alone together and the morning after. In the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, boys and girls are raised almost entirely separately. While young men are educated not to look at or think about women, young women are taught to dress, think and behave with modesty.
