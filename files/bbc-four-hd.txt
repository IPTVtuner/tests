Alan Yentob presents the incredible story of a mysterious nanny who died in 2009 leaving a secret hoard of thousands of stunning photographs. Never seen in her lifetime, they were found by chance in a Chicago storage locker and auctioned off cheaply. Now Vivian Maier's magical pictures sell for thousands of dollars. In life she was a recluse, a hoarder, spinning tall tales about her French roots.
