Day two of the Glastonbury coverage sees the set by Burt Bacharach, the legendary singer and songwriter of countless classic songs from the late 1950s onwards, including 52 UK Top 40 hits. Back in 2000, Bacharach was unable to perform at the festival due to a shoulder injury, but now he finally makes his debut on the Pyramid stage to perform a selection of those classic tracks from his wonderful back catalogue.
