For over two decades, Other Voices has brought artists and storytellers to the edge of the world, capturing powerful and intimate performances in the breathtaking setting of Dingle, County Kerry. Tucked away on the main street of this small town on Ireland's west coast, a tiny church plays host to an extraordinary gathering of musicians - from the legendary to the musical stars of tomorrow.
