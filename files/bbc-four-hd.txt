In Levittown, Andrew Graham-Dixon uncovers the dark side of post-war consumerism and the role artists have played in challenging the status quo. He visits New York's Metropolitan Museum to see the most subversive artwork of 1950s America, Jasper Johns's White Flag, examines Andy Warhol's soup can paintings and interviews one of the last surviving pop artists, James Rosenquist.
