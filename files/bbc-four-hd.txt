The Inspector Lynley Mysteries first appeared on our screens in 2001 and had viewers instantly hooked by the combination of puzzling crimes and murder investigations, spiced up with the added clash-of-class relationship between its two main cast members: Nathaniel Parker, as DI Thomas Linley, 8th Earl of Asherton, and Sharon Small, as his far less sophisticated Detective Sergeant, Barbara Havers.
