George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue (1924) is a landmark in 20th century music. Gershwin drew upon the jazz music enveloping New York City in the 1920s to create the `American Sound', which would inspire generations of composers in years to come. Josie D'Arby presents the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra with pianist Marc Andr√© Hamelin, conducted by Thomas Dausgaard, performing the piece in full from Glasgow's City Halls.
