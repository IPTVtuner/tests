This is the story of the first International Double Bass Competition and Workshop on the Isle of Man in summer 1978. It's also the story of what happened in the holiday resort of Port Erin when 200 double bass players arrived from all over the world. Gary Karr, one of the world's great bass players, left everyone gasping with his displays of virtuosity, and from then on, the scene was set for the most extraordinary and hilarious international event that anyone on the island had ever seen before.
