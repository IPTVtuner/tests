Finding out if two anonymous landscape paintings, discovered at Birmingham Art Gallery, could be by artists whose work profoundly influenced the development of European landscape painting in the 17th and 18th centuries. The first, a very badly damaged picture whose panel has spilt into two pieces is currently just attributed to the Flemish School rather than any single artist. The second is a forest scene thought to be a copy of a famous painting by Gainsborough.
