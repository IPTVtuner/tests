Once upon a time, not so long ago, there was a man whose name was Oliver Postgate. He had a shed where he made things. With his friend Peter Firmin, Oliver created characters including `Bagpuss', `The Clangers' and `Ivor the Engine'. These stories fired the imaginations of generations of children, and his lullaby voice became a universal reminder of childhood.
