Nigel Hawthorne stars in this lyrical comedy-drama, inspired by some of John Betjeman's poems. It combines Jim Parker's music, played by the Nash Ensemble, and dance, by members of Adventures in Motion Pictures, as well as the words of Betjeman, spoken by the poet himself. Cousin John, an amiable elderly gentleman, visits a country house one weekend. His fellow guests are an energetic group of young people, leaving Cousin John on the fringes of the activity, watching wistfully.
