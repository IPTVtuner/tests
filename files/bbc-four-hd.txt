Documentary drama exploring the last days of Napoleon's life in exile on the island of St Helena. To the British, Napoleon has always been an ogre - an enemy, a foreign despot - but he is also remembered as a man of incredible energy, who laid the foundations of the modern French state. In exile on St Helena, he fought his last battle with words, turning defeat at Waterloo to his advantage, presenting himself as the rescuer of France and a man who hated war.
