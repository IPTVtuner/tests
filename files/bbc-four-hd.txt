Siân Phillips is joined by directors Moira Armstrong and Waris Hussein, to look back on the 1974 drama series Shoulder to Shoulder, which told the story of the Pankhurst family and the birth of the women's suffrage movement. Over six episodes, the series followed the challenges that faced the Pankhursts as they launched the fight for the right for women to vote, with Siân taking on the key role of the matriarch Emmeline Pankhurst and Moira and Waris sharing directing responsibilities.
