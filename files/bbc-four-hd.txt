Daniel Barenboim's complete cycle of Beethoven symphonies reaches its climactic conclusion. The ninth `choral' symphony, with its passionate vision of human reconciliation, is performed at the Royal Albert Hall by the young musicians of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, the National Youth Choir of Great Britain and an international quartet of soloists - Anna Samuil, Waltraud Meier, Peter Seiffert and Rene Pape.
