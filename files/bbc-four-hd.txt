Danish director Mads Brügger and Swedish private investigator Göran Björkdahl are trying to solve the mysterious death of Dag Hammarskjöld. As their investigation closes in, they discover a crime far worse than the murder of the secretary-general of the United Nations. In 1961, United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld's plane mysteriously crashed, killing Hammarskjöld and most of the crew.
