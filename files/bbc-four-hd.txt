Victoria Wood makes a round trip to the north of Britain from Crewe, taking in both the east and west coasts. On her way north she visits Carnforth station, location of the classic film `Brief Encounter', takes the North West Regional Railways service across Morecambe Bay to Barrow and the Cumbrian Coastal line to Carlisle before reaching Thurso, the most northerly point possible by train.
