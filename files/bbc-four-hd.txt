Project Manager, Lih Ling Highe, leads the installation of thousands of kilometres of vital power cables through the largest station on the Elizabeth Line: Tottenham Court Road. Tottenham Court Road is also expected to be one of the busiest underground stations attracting 200,000 passengers a day. If the cables are damaged or incorrectly wired, the station cannot be switched on and the project will be delayed once more.
