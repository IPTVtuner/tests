When Elizabeth Bennet meets the wealthy and eligible Mr Darcy, she is at first put off by his proud manner and his disdain for the ill-judged behaviour of her mother and younger sisters. The growing attraction between them, however, will cause both Elizabeth and Darcy to reassess their initial impressions as they discover each other's true character.
