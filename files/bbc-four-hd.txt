Disenchanted investigative journalist Martin Scarsden is told by his boss to write a follow-up piece a year after a mass shooting of five parishioners by a charismatic young priest in the small rural town of Riversend. The townsfolk do not look kindly on yet more intrusion into their still raw lives, but Scarsden begins to doubt the accepted version of events of that tragic day.
