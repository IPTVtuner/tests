Lucinda Lambton travels along the Great North Road, the backbone of Britain that links London to Edinburgh. Among the weird and wonderful delights she discovers en route are a calico grotto in London, a Victorian staircase encrusted with trumpeting cherubs, a lost domain in Yorkshire and a hotel saloon with an unexpected past.
