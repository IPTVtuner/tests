Celebrated theatre, film and television director Richard Eyre has forged links with some of Britain's finest writers - one of the most notable being Trevor Griffiths, whose landmark piece, Comedians, he directed, as well as this prescient and still relevant production, Country. Set on the night of the Labour Party's momentous election victory in 1945, Country contains the rage and compassion for which Griffiths was well known.
