Painter Hedley Shale is found dead in the bedroom of his home, with his secret lover, model Francesca Boutron, bound and gagged at his side. Shale's wife, Serena, appears to be the killer, but she was at work throughout the morning on her side of town. Investigative crime journalist Maddy Magellan is suspicious of Serena's alibi, and enlists Jonathan Creek, the technical helper of a top magician, to help in her enquiries.
