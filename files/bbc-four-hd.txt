Michael Portillo is in East Anglia on the last leg of his rail journey through 1930s Britain. He begins in Attleborough in Norfolk at the headquarters of an international horse welfare organisation which was established in the late 1920s and learns about the charity's pioneering founder. Crossing the Fens, Michael's next stop is the cathedral city of Peterborough.
