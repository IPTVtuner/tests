Michael Aspel and the team visit Wilton House near Salisbury where a rich hoard of treasures and curiosities are brought to light. Included in the day's finds are a hoard of 200 typewriters, a suffragette doll dressed in clothes cut down from women protestors' prison uniforms, a ring once worn by the daughter of Charles I, and an ornate table, transported in the back of a horsebox.
