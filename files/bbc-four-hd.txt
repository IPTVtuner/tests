The Marsh Pride of Kenya's Masai Mara is in a unique situation in their history. They have been abandoned by all of the adult males, and just two adult females are left to feed and protect their eight youngsters. The future of the whole family rests entirely on the shoulders of these two mothers, Charm and her cousin Sienna. They need to raise their cubs to adulthood if this great dynasty is to continue, and they all face the great perils of the African savannah.
