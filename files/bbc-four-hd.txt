Historian David Olusoga looks back on the 1986 BBC drama documentary Artists and Models, which had a profound influence on him as a young man. David remembers how the series ignited in him a love of art and history that would go on to determine his own career and lifelong passions. The series was influential in its day for its use of long, thoughtful shots of classical artwork, which David says has had a lasting impact on the television series he makes today.
