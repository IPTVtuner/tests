Fourteen months after the first massacres, sixteen people, including three young children, are reported missing in the remote French region area of Vercors. France is in shock. Very quickly, they are identified as members of the Order of the Solar Temple. Eight days after their disappearance, sixteen incinerated bodies are found in remote woodland, in the small sleepy village of Saint-Pierre-de-Ch√©rennes.
