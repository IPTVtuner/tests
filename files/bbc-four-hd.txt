To celebrate the 350th anniversary of the Royal Observatory, The Sky at Night is recreating history. In the times of the early Astronomers Royal, scientists would gather at spectacular dinner parties at Flamsteed House in Greenwich to share ideas and discuss the universe. In 2025, 350 years on from the first ground stones being laid, we come together once again to discover how the work at the Royal Observatory defined the prime meridian.
