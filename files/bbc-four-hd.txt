To mark the 70th anniversary of the `miracle of Dunkirk', fifty of the surviving `Little Ships' which made the original perilous cross-channel voyage, are returning to France. Dan Snow tells the extraordinary story of these Little Ships, their role in the evacuation and the people who struggled to keep them afloat today during those fateful days in 1940, when the future of Europe hung in the balance.
