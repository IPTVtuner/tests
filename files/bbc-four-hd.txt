Dame Maureen Lipman shares her experiences of playing her own mother-in-law in the TV film The Evacuees, an autobiographical account written by her late husband Jack Rosenthal of his experiences as a young evacuee in wartime. Lipman discusses the depths of Rosenthal's touching, funny and political play, which documents the experiences of two young Jewish brothers as they navigate life in the cold, unfeeling home of Mr and Mrs Graham.
