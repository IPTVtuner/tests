The final programme of the series looks at the life and times of Tutankhamun himself. The discovery of his treasure-filled tomb made this king world-famous - the one ancient Egyptian that everyone has heard of - but paradoxically, the details of his life are harder to make out than those of many other less well-known pharaohs. His was a short and not very glorious reign in a troubled time, and a lot of detective work has been needed to piece together the facts about him.
