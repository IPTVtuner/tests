In the aftermath of the war in Afghanistan, western troops were part of a Nato force, working with the then new Afghan authorities to help 'win the hearts and minds' of locals, with Danish and British troops deployed in the key southern province of Helmand. In this Storyville film, a former Danish soldier turned film-maker goes back to Musa Qala, the capital of Helmand, to investigate allegations that the Afghan police were abusing young boys and men when the Danish and British were in control.
