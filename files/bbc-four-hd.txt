What was intended as a day of fun turns into a day of agony for everyone on the Box Hill excursion. Things come to a head when, egged on by Frank, Emma behaves very badly, insulting Miss Bates. She is berated by Knightley, and realises that her behaviour was shameful. She tries to repair things with Jane and Miss Bates, but Jane will not see her.
