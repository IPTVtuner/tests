Made across six months, in the run up to publication of `The Mirror and the Light', the final book in Hilary Mantel's Booker-winning Tudor trilogy on the life of Thomas Cromwell, this film enjoys access to one of the world's greatest living writers delving into the present and her past as she describes a vivid imagination active from an early age, and recounts with candour a tale of growing up with a dark family secret.
