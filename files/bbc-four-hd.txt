Compilation of some indelible hits by artists we hardly heard from again. Featuring Peter Sarstedt's Where Do You Go To My Lovely? a number one in 1969, a hit he never really matched; Trio's 1982 smash Da Da Da; Phyllis Nelson's 1985 lovers rock-style classic Move Closer; and the New Radicals' 1999 hit You Get What You Give. We travel through the years selecting some of your favourite number ones and a few others that came close, revealing what's happened to the one-hit wonders since.
