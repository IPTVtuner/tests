The Pink Panther, Moon River and more as the BBC Proms mark the centenary of one of the greatest composers in the history of film and TV - Henry Mancini. In this celebration of the man and his music, favourites from Mancini sit alongside much-loved tunes from the genres he inspired, including lounge music and space-age pop from the likes of Burt Bacharach, Les Baxter and Juan Garcia Esquivel.
