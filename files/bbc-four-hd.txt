The Imperial War Museum in Manchester, designed by Daniel Libeskind, is a stunning example of a new wave of architectural design that is both dramatic and disturbing, a building that plays with the senses and provokes wonder. In his final climb of the series, Jonathan, aided by top climber Lucy Creamer, scales over 50 metres up the building to reveal how the museum is designed to reflect war itself.
