Professor Brian Cox begins his exploration of the cosmos with a hymn to the great luminous bodies that bring light and warmth to the universe: the stars. It is estimated that there are two hundred trillion stars in the universe, each playing their part in an epic story of creation, a great saga that stretches from the dawn of time, with the arrival of the first star, through diverse generations until the arrival of our own star, the Sun, and a civilisation that has grown up in its light.
