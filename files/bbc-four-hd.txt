Esteemed actor Brian Cox looks back on the filming of the 1991 movie The Lost Language of Cranes, about a man struggling to come to terms with his own sexuality and family secrets after his son announces he is gay. The film of love and loss, adapted from the novel by David Leavitt, came about during the Aids epidemic, and was groundbreaking for its time as gay cinema was still in its infancy.
