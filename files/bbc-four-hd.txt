Michael Portillo's exploration of the West Country continues in south Devon. Guided by his 1930s Bradshaw's, Michael arrives in Paignton to investigate an extraordinarily high murder rate in the literature of the 1930s. The Dartmouth Steam Railway conveys him in style to the beautiful home of Agatha Christie, in the company of her great-grandson, James Prichard.
