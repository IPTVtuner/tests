BBC Red Button 1
Today, October 19
Tess and Claud welcome you to another weekend of Strictly, as our remaining couples show off the results of their latest week of training. Who will triumph on the dancefloor, and who will be in need of your help? As always, the judges will be providing the scores, and at the end of the show, you have the chance to save your favourites. With signing.
