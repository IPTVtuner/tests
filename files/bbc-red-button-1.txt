Gary Lineker introduces live coverage as the two most successful sides in FA Cup history battle it out for a place in the fourth round. Arsenal have lifted the trophy a record 14 times, one more than Manchester United, who have appeared in an unrivalled 22 finals, including last season's 2-1 victory against neighbours Manchester City. The teams met at the Emirates Stadium in the Premier League in December, with the Gunners triumphing 2-0 to inflict Ruben Amorim's first defeat as United manager.
