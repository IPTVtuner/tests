BBC Red Button 1
Today, September 21
It's the first live show of Strictly Come Dancing 2024 and our professional dancers open it in style with a fabulously fiery group number. Join Tess and Claud live from the ballroom as our 15 brand new couples perform their opening routines of the competition. Whilst there's no public vote this week, there will be plenty of paddle action from our judges Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Anton Du Beke and Shirley Ballas. With signing.
