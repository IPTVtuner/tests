Two of the top sides in Super League renew rivalries in the last eight of rugby league's most prestigious knockout competition. Neighbours Warrington and St Helens have been familiar foes in the Challenge Cup in recent years - this is the fourth meeting in the last seven years, with the Wolves triumphing in the last three, including a comprehensive 31-8 victory at this exact stage last season. The two sides also faced off in a bruising battle in the Super League eliminators in 2024.
