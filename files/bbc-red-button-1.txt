BBC Red Button 1
Today, April 14
Two of the most successful sides in the history of rugby league's eminent knockout competition meet in a re-run of the 2019 final, in which Warrington Wolves beat St Helens 18-4 as underdogs. They went on to defeat St Helens again, this time by just two points, when the sides last met in the Challenge Cup in the 2020 quarter-finals. But the Red V lifted the trophy for a 13th time in 2021 and have reached the semi-finals in each of the past two seasons.
