Mark Chapman presents live coverage as Hull KR, runners-up in the Super League last season, face Catalans Dragons in the semi-finals of rugby league's oldest cup competition. The Robins have been in impressive form this season, having made the grand final for the first time in 2024, and they will next attempt to reach the Challenge Cup final for the first time since 2023, when they lost in golden-point extra time to Leigh.
