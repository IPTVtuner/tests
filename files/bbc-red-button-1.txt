Live FA Cup action from east London as reigning Premier League champions Manchester City seek to avoid a colossal upset against League One Leyton Orient in the fourth round. City have lifted the iconic trophy seven times, reaching the final on a further six occasions, including last season. Their only FA Cup defeat to a lower league side during Pep Guardiola's reign was a shock 1-0 loss to Wigan in 2018, and they thrashed League Two outfit Salford City 8-0 in the previous round.
