Today, August 11
As the Olympic flame is extinguished to signal the end of the games in Paris, Clare Balding revisits the standout stories and images from a remarkable 16 days and 329 events. With signing. The Olympic motto has been embodied once again, with thousands of athletes across 32 sports striving to be faster, higher or stronger and, in doing so, bringing people together. Clare will hand to Hazel Irvine and Andrew Cotter for the closing ceremony at the Stade de France.
