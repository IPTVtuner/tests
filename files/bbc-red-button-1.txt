Today, April 14
Coverage of this tantalising rematch of 2023's final, when Leigh won their first Challenge Cup title for 52 years courtesy of a golden point drop goal by Lachlan Lam. Hull KR avenged that dramatic 17-16 defeat the following month by eliminating Leigh from the Super League play-offs, but their wait for cup glory dates back to 1980.
