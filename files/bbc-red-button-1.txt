Mark Chapman is at Wembley, where Warrington Wolves and Hull Kingston Rovers meet in the final of rugby league's most iconic competition. The sides first met in the final 120 years ago, with Warrington lifting the trophy for the first time. The Wolves have gone on to win the cup on a further eight occasions but will still be smarting from losing last year's final to Wigan. Hull KR were themselves runners-up in 2023, agonisingly losing to Leigh on golden point.
