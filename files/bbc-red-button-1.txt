Watch coverage as some of the biggest superstars in world athletics descend on the French capital for an enthralling evening of track and field. Among the athletes on display will be Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who returns to Charl√©ty Stadium a year on from stupendously breaking the long-standing world record of 2.09m, set by Bulgarian Stefka Kostadinova at the World Championships in Rome way back in 1987.
