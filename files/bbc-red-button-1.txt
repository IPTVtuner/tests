BBC Red Button 1
Today, January 23
A welcome return for an audience favourite - Winterwatch's Mindfulness Moments. This is an opportunity to switch off from the stresses of our busy lives, immerse ourselves in pure nature, and take a moment to rest and re-charge. No music, no presenter voice-over, just natural sound and glorious wildlife pictures to take us to the most stunning places in this most chilly of seasons.
