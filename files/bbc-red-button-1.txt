Manish Bhasin introduces all the goals and major talking points from this weekend's second-round ties, featuring six non-league teams with home advantage against EFL opponents. Fifth-tier Chesterfield's reward for knocking out former FA Cup winners Portsmouth in the first round was another home tie against a League One side, with Leyton Orient the visitors. Eastleigh were also looking to bridge a two-division gap when they hosted Reading.
