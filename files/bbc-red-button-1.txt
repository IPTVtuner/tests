Winter is a season of extremes - from frosty mornings and snowy days to grey days of endless drizzle - it can be a tough time of year for us and our wildlife. With an overarching theme of Resilience and Renewal, Winterwatch will be shining a light on the wildlife and people who battle through this inhospitable season and come out the other side. We're here to warm your bones and your soul and this time it's through four extraordinary encounters with wildlife.
