Another chance to see the best of the action from the 2024 FA Cup final between local rivals Manchester City and Manchester United. The two sides are contesting the final of English football's showpiece club competition for a second successive season. Pep Guardiola's side beat Chelsea 1-0 in April's semi-final, thanks to Bernardo Silva's decisive 84th minute strike, while United let a three-goal lead slip to Championship side Coventry City before recovering to win on penalties.
