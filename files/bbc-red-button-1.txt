Coverage as Leeds Rhinos bid to continue their strong start to the Super League season as they take on struggling Castleford Tigers at The Jungle. Leeds were 38-24 winners when the sides met at Headingley in March, running in seven tries to Castleford's four. The Rhinos have surprisingly failed to make the play-offs in each of the past two seasons but are determined to put that right under new Australian head coach Brad Arthur.
