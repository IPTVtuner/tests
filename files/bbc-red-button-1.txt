BBC Red Button 1
Today, December 07
It's semi-final weekend in the ballroom, and that means double dancing for our remaining couples as they perform two brand new routines. Our judges, Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Anton Du Beke and Shirley Ballas, will be providing their expert opinions and awarding the scores, before you have the chance to vote for your Strictly finalists. With signing.
