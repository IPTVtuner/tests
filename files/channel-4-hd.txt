Anarchic, nihilistic satire on modern life in which an office worker, who feels emotionally deadened by his consumerist lifestyle, has a chance encounter with a charismatic man. Finding that they are kindred spirits, the two men start up a no-holds-barred bare-knuckle fighting club, with the aim of making its members feel alive once again.
