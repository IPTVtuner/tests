Three singing chipmunks are happily residing in a lovely tree, until their green home gets chopped down and taken to be the Christmas tree in the reception of an LA record company. There, they buddy up with failing songwriter Dave, who realises the talented critters have got the potential for big musical success. When the chipmunks are signed by big-shot producer Ian, will fame and fortune go to their heads?
