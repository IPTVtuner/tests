Today, November 30
A day in the lives of Homer, Lisa and Bart, with each of their stories told separately but interrelated. Homer's thumb is sliced off when he tries to sneak a brownie from Marge and the journey to Dr Nick's in Rainer Wolfcastle's Ferrari is not a simple one. Lisa misses the school bus on the day she was due to enter her grammar robot Linguo in the science fair, and Bart plays with Fat Tony's stash of smuggled fireworks.
