Kirstie and Phil are in Liverpool, seeking out the best property for some very picky house hunters, including community worker Vee Wright who is mum to two teenage boys, and Cath Callaghan who loves her peace and quiet. Just up the road, single student Kate Harland longs for her first-ever home, desperate to escape her noisy, messy, student flat for something a bit more grown up.
