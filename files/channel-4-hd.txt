Marmee is the head of the March household in the absence of her husband, who's away fighting in the US Civil War. Her daughters range from the headstrong Jo and sweet Beth, to domesticated Meg and wilful Amy. The film follows the trials and tribulations of the girls, from early poverty and tragedy to Jo's later efforts to secure both a husband and a successful writing career, and Amy's relationship with an old family friend.
