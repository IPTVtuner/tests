Based on three hybridising narrative strands, three groups of villains are intent on retrieving a missing diamond. Turkish and Tommy team up with a pugilistic Irish gypsy named Mickey for the purpose of rigging unlicensed boxing matches. However, their opponent also arranges some dodgy betting with the courier of the stolen diamond, who subsequently goes missing. To complicate further, a New York gangster arrives on the scene.
