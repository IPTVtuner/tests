George travels to North Yorkshire to meet couple Paul and Rachel, who hope to combine a mutual love of railways and gin by transforming an old goods wagon into a summerhouse and gin bar. In a small town near Madrid, George meets the man who has spent the last 50 years building a cathedral of epic proportions by hand. There is also a narrowboat conversion in Buckinghamshire, and work continues on George and Will's expandable caravan pod.
