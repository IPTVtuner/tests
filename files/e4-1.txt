Ted is sick of having to take long trips to New Jersey to see Stella and is aghast when she tells him she wants to live there once they marry. Ted and his friends visits Stella in New Jersey and a row erupts over the merits of New Jersey over New York. Robin, meanwhile, hands in her notice and then grovels for her job back after being turned down at an interview for another role.
