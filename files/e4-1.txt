Homer agrees to let Fat Tony shoot a porn film in his home as compensation for football gambling debts. He sends the family for a July afternoon at Santa's Village, but when they return ahead of schedule, Marge blows her top and storms out leaving Homer to watch the children. At a rest stop, Marge befriends an attractive marine biologist who tells her that Homer will never appreciate her if she continues to run back to him.
