In the first of an explosive two-part special, Gordon tries to turn around the fortunes of Los Angeles restaurant, the Burger Kitchen. It's only been open for 16 months but has already changed its menu more than 10 times, as well as going through 10 chefs and 10 waitresses, and owner Alan has spent his son's inheritance on the restaurant without permission, leading to much family conflict.
