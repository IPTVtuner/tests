The First Dates restaurant serves up another platter of hopeful singletons. Forensics analyst Chelsea meets Alec, who in the past has relied on his Italian roots and unusual dating tricks (lies) to woo the ladies. As Alex pretends to speak fluent Italian, he and Chelsea bond over a banana. Will Alex be honest with Chelsea or will she fall for his charm? Colin, who was born with a birth defect resulting in a missing leg, has been on over 100 first dates.
