Today, March 17
The first part of a two-part visit to the Juniper Hill Inn in Windsor, Vermont, a place that looks like a million dollars but smells of raw sewage. Gordon meets the inn's wealthy owner, Robert Dean II, and uncovers some shocking treatment towards the staff. Gordon quickly realises that it's going to need something approaching a miracle if he's going to have a chance of saving the place.
