Gordon heads to America in a bid to rescue failing restaurant owners from imminent disaster and provide them with a recipe for success. In this first episode, Gordon visits the Hot Potato Café in Fishtown, Philadelphia. With no profit made in its two years of trading and an influential restaurant reviewer dubbing them `Spuddy Hell', Gordon soon realises Hot Potato may have had its chips.
