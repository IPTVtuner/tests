Ian and Butzy are searching for treasures in Ireland's largest county - Cork. They go picking at an 11th Century castle built by the grandson of Brian Boru, high king of Ireland. Undeterred by its turbulent past and tales of ghosts Ian discovers a mysterious stone head, a carving of a famous figure from Irish mythology, and a gadget he just loves even though it dates not from the 1060s but the 1960s.
