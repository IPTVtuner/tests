Top Dublin dealer Ian Dowling and his mate Butzy head south of Dublin to County Wexford and three picking locations. In Wexford town they visit the Sky and The Ground pub where hoarder Landlord Johnny Baron's wife Nuala thinks it's time for a clear-out of her husband's cluttered attic. At Loch Garman antiques the boys meet up with owner William Plummer, who's recently opened his doors to the public and Ian is the first dealer through the door.
