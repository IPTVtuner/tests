In 1999, a suburban mum, Marlene Bradford lost her house after her husband died and, possessing very few street smarts, she was forced to live in her station wagon with her daughters, ages 9 and 14. Now, an environmental group finds Marlene's car with her decomposed body in it at the bottom of a lake. She had been shot. After her disappearance, her daughters were placed with separate families and lost touch.
