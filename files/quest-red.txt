Quest Red
Today, October 10
Cherry Durbin, 68, grew up knowing she had been adopted at birth but what she didn't know was that she had an older sister. After successfully locating her mother, she has reached out for help in finding her older sister. The second search is on behalf of 25-year-old mum, Naomi Wilson, who has spent years searching for her dad who disappeared from her life 20-years ago.
