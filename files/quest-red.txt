Quest Red
Today, April 18
A scientist is deliberately exposed to a deadly toxin at a high-security biological research facility. Before she dies, she calls Jane to ask for his help in finding her killer. Once the agents have arrived on scene, however, another empty flask of the toxin is discovered, suggesting all those inside the facility have just hours to live.
