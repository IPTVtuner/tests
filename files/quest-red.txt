Quest Red
Today, March 29
When a wealthy white teenager and a struggling black teenager from very different towns were murdered at the same exact time of day in 2002, no one made a connection. Now Miller, who was an undercover cop at the time, realises that the killings may be related, and she persuades Rush to reopen the cases. One may have got himself into a turf war with drug dealers, and the other is initially believed to have been taking drugs.
