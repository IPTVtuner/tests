Quest Red
Today, March 28
In 2005, a brilliant and driven honours student, James Hoffman, was destined for the best colleges and went missing. Now, his sister finds a video clip on the internet of James getting brutally beaten and shows it to Rush and Valens, who reopen the investigation into James' disappearance. They learn that he had secretly become a member of a `fight club' of overstressed rich kids looking for a thrill.
