Quest Red
Today, October 16
Adopted as a baby, Laura McCarthy had an unhappy childhood and hoped that finding her real mother would give her a sense of belonging. She later discovered that she has a half sister called Alison, but has been unable to find either her sister or her mother. Sarah Gale was also adopted, but despite being brought up by a loving family, has been unable to shake the feeling that something is missing from her life.
