Today, March 29
When evidence of a pipe bomb is found in a suburban home during renovations, Rush reopens the case of a married couple killed in 1981 in what was termed an accidental gas leak explosion at the time. As she digs into the history of the couple and their friends, Rush learns that, ten years earlier, they had all been linked by their opposition to the Vietnam War.
