Today, December 20
Peter Arundel, 58, has always known he was adopted as a baby but never asked about his birth mother out of respect for his adoptive parents. Since they passed away 20-years ago, Peter has been trying to uncover the circumstances of his adoption and he is desperate to meet his birth mother before it is too late. Meanwhile, Maureen Saville is looking for the mother who abandoned her as a toddler over 60-years ago.
