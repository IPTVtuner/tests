Today, March 27
When Jeffries' former partner shares new information about the murder in 2000 of a male singer, the case is reopened, requiring Rush and a reluctant Scotty to travel to Knoxville, Tennessee, and delve into the world of country music. The victim was caught between women from two very different worlds - one Southern, one Northern - and the detectives must untangle a web of love, destruction and booze.
