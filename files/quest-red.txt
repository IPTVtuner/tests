Quest Red
Today, December 11
Twenty four-year-old Alice Ruggles was a bright young woman who had everything to live for, until she met Lance Corporal Harry Dhillon. After a short-lived romance, Alice ended the relationship in the summer of 2016, whereupon Dhillon commenced his reign of stalking and threats, culminating in one final act of terror on the evening of the 12th October 2016.
