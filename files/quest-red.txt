Quest Red
Today, March 26
A case that Jeffries worked on when he was a rookie in 1979 is reopened when evidence is found near the original location of the female victim's body. Jeffries made a promise to the woman's daughter to find her mother's killer and now, armed with new evidence, he is more determined than ever to close the case and bring the murderer to justice.
