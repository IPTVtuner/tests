Quest Red
Today, March 19
A pregnant woman researching her family history realises that her great-grandmother, Violet Holley, died in an unsolved murder. Rush tackles the 1929 case, her oldest to date, but she finds only a few notes revealing that underprivileged Violet had become pregnant by a wealthy man, Nick Bartleby. The recollections of those suspects who are still alive cannot be considered reliable, but Rush does locate Nick's great-grandson.
