Rush and Valens reopen the 2001 case involving a well-liked local deli owner, Frank Dicenzio, who was apparently beaten to death by his employee. Valens is contacted by the brother of a convicted murderer and is persuaded to reopen the case that left a local neighbourhood shocked. Everyone loved Frank, and no one could imagine someone taking his life. All of the evidence points to Frank's top employee.
