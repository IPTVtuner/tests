Rush and Scotty reopen a 1998 accidental death case when new evidence suggests that it may have been murder. The investigators enter the picture-perfect world of the wealthy Williams clan but soon discover that no family is perfect, especially not this one. The once-gorgeous matriarch, Lauren Williams, was stranded at her ex-husband's home during a snowstorm, along with her two children, but found later drowned in the pool.
