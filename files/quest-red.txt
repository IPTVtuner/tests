Quest Red
Today, October 18
Samantha's father disappeared from her life when she was a child, and she grew up with a white family to whom she bears no resemblance. Desperate to make sense of her cultural identity, she has struggled for years to find her father. The show also follows Carole, who grew up an only child with her mother after her parents' divorce - until one day when Carole's father and his new family came to spend the day with her.
