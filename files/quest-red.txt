Deputy Police Chief Brenda Johnson returns in season two of the critically acclaimed series. In this first episode, a murder scene is nothing new to the Priority Homicide Division, but when one of the victims is a police detective, the pressure is on to close the case. Brenda and her team take heat from top police brass as their investigation turns away from a known drug dealer and towards one of their own.
