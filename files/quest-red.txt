Quest Red
Today, March 16
Rush receives new evidence in the 1973 murder of a female college tennis phenomenon, Andi, who beat the school's best male player, Fritz, in a high-profile match. Fritz had always been the main suspect since he had no solid alibi and his loss not only embarrassed him but also cost him major endorsement deals. Fritz was also known to lend towels to Andi, and the evidence of her murder includes a towel soaked in sodium.
