Quest Red
Today, October 12
Fiona Dunn was brought up in the 1960s by a couple she believed were her natural parents. Later, she discovered that the woman she thought was her mother was in fact her aunt and that she was the child of her uncle and his mistress. Then, she was told that she had a younger sister whom the family had kept secret from her for her entire life. The show also meets Anne Clegg who has always longed to know her birth mother.
