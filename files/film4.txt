An isolated group of American scientists in the Antarctic come across the frozen remains of an alien organism. However, it soon becomes clear that the creature, which can take on the form of any living thing, is very much alive. A remake of the 1951 classic, oozing with stunning effects, and definitely not for those of a fragile disposition.
