Professor Smith is a mild-mannered archaeologist who, under the guise of searching for Aryan artefacts near the Swiss border, smuggles refuges from the Nazis to safety. However, his most dangerous rescue takes him to Berlin, to save a young girl who believes she is helping the Germans with information that will accidentally betray his organisation.
