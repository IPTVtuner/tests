Cavalry officer Kern Shafter is reduced to the ranks after a fight with fellow officer Edward Garnett. Ten years later, Shafter finds himself posted to Dakota where Garnett is the commanding officer. Garnett assigns him the most dangerous of scouting duties among Sioux and Cheyenne tribes and, to complicate matters, they both fall for the same woman, with the action culminating at the Battle of Little Big Horn.
