Aliens reach Earth and they're clearly hostile: their plan is to suck the planet of all its resources, leave behind a burnt cinder circling the sun, and move on. Planting giant ships above the world's major cities, they unleash destruction on an unprecedented scale. All attempts to fight back are met by hordes of fighter craft until pilot Steven Hiller manages to down one and capture its pilot.
