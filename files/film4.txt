Audie Murphy was the most decorated American soldier of World War II, including the Medal of Honor among the 27 US decorations he received. Amid the bravery (single-handedly knocking out a German machine gun nest, almost single-handedly holding up a tank advance), he also found time to have a little romance with an Italian girl named Maria.
