Richard is a thirty-something sales assistant whose wife Cath has left him for their son's PE teacher Gary. The reason she's left is Richard's weekend pastime; he's obsessed with historical battle re-enactment. To win Cath back, he should cut his hair, put the sword away and start to act his age. Sometimes, only a warrior's bold heart can win the maiden fair.
