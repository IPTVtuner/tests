In a remote New England town, an eerie mist strands people in the supermarket. `There's nothing out there' says lawyer Brent. `Nothing in the mist'. However, there is: something that feeds on human flesh. As the extent of the terror becomes clear, the townsfolk are split between resolute David Drayton and weird Mrs Carmody, who warns that this is divine punishment for their sins.
