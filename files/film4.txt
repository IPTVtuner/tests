Based on Jack Rosenthal's childhood memories, Michael Apted's film, set in the summer of 1948, features 14-year-old Alan who has just three wishes: that there will be lasting peace, that England will win the Ashes and that he will finally kiss classmate Ann. So when he's cast opposite her in a play that requires a kiss and England seem to be doing well in the cricket, life couldn't be better.
