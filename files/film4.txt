Slapstick film about a divorced actor who is willing to go to any lengths to get his children back, even posing as a matronly Scottish housekeeper. His family, taken in by the disguise, decide to employ the eccentric but apparently capable widow, and everyone is happy with the arrangement - until the mother's old boyfriend reappears and tries to become a father figure to the children.
