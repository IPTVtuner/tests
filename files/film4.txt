Turner is a meticulously groomed, excruciatingly well-organised detective working in a small California coastal town. When local character John McIntyre is murdered by drug smugglers, the only witness is McIntyre's slobbery, smelly mutt Hooch. Turner, who despises dogs in general and Hooch in particular, is compelled to put the cantankerous dog up as his house guest.
