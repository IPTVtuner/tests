Fast-paced adventures of a nine-month-old infant on the loose in Chicago. The baby first gives three hapless kidnappers the slip, then spends the day recreating adventures from his favourite storybook, `Baby's Day Out'. The three crooks, the baby's parents and the FBI all give chase, but the child's nanny, realising the importance of the book, tries to anticipate his next move.
