Two ex-GIs take up oil prospecting in the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana, but the local shrimp fishermen fear that any success will spoil their livelihoods, and to make matters worse, the two guys fall for the daughters of one of the port's leading captains. As tensions come to a head and the fleet set out to the oil rig, not only is black gold struck but something else golden is discovered that will make them all rich men.
