Stephen Neale is released from an asylum for the `mercy' killing of his incurably sick wife. By chance, he's drawn to a London funfair where he wins a cake by guessing its weight, but the cake contains a secret message for a ring of Nazi spies and Neale is unwittingly drawn into the conspiracy led by the mysterious Cost, also known as Travers. Plus, only Inspector Prentice believes him.
