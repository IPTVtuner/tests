John and Jane Smith are a typical suburban couple first seen undergoing marriage counselling to try and get the spark back in their relationship. What neither of them knows is that the other is a highly skilled assassin until, separately, they get a call for their next job. Accidentally double-booked, they discover the truth about each other's secret existence, and are in danger not just from their bosses, but each other.
