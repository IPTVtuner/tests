Nicknamed the `Tooth Fairy' due to his penchant for knocking out other players' teeth, an arrogant hockey player's moniker becomes very apt when he steals a dollar that his girlfriend Carly's daughter has left for the real Tooth Fairy. Sprouting wings, Derek is summoned to meet the leader of the fairies, Lily, who labels him a `dream crusher' and orders him to serve as a tooth fairy to make up for his transgressions.
