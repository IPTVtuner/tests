Napoleon is in exile on St Helena after defeat at Waterloo, but his supporters find a double, a humble sailor. The plan is for them to swap roles and Napoleon returning to Paris and glory. Unfortunately, things don't go according to plan; the imposter decides not to reveal himself, leaving the ex-Emperor to eke out a living as a commoner, although at least in the company of Nicole `Pumpkin' Truchaut.
