Bittersweet film about a gang of four 12-year-old boys growing up in Oregon in the 1950s. The story is told in flashback years afterwards by one of the boys - now a writer - and revolves around their search through the countryside around their hometown for the body of a missing teenager, thought to have been killed by a train. Adapted from `The Body', a novella by Stephen King.
