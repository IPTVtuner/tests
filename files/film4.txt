Myles Falworth, the son of a disgraced knight, is determined to prove himself. With the help of the Earl of Mackworth and despite the sneers of his contemporaries, he trains for his knighthood and finally earns his spurs and the nation's thanks when he foils a plot to de-throne King Henry IV. His love interest is Lady Anne Mackworth, while the Earl of Alban is the requisite baddie that Falworth must overcome.
