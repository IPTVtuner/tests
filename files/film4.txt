An English butler's professional and emotional life is examined retrospectively during a journey towards a reunion with the housekeeper he loved years before. He recalls his lengthy unquestioned service with a reactionary, pro-Nazi aristocrat, and his painfully unfulfilled relationship with the woman he is going to meet.
