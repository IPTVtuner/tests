Ralls is the sadistic two-fisted captain of the Red Witch, a square rigger plying its trade in the East Indies. He's at loggerheads with the ship's owner Mayrant Sidneye and in flashback, the reason is revealed: the beautiful Angelique Desaix spurned Ralls for Sidneye. Ralls is planning his revenge - he scuppers the bullion-carrying ship on an uncharted reef, planning to return and claim the gold for himself.
