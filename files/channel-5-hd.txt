Ross acts on Monica's advice and tells Emily that he loves her just before her departure for London. Unfortunately Emily's immediate response isn't exactly reassuring. Elsewhere, Phoebe receives some rather surprising news about her pregnancy, while Chandler and Joey are glued to their TV for fear of losing the free pornography channel they are suddenly receiving.
