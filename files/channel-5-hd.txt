Ross learns that a pregnant Rachel wants to move out and find a place of her own, so he suggests a vacancy in his building. Then he learns that the elderly occupant is not quite dead yet. Meanwhile, Phoebe is ecstatic when Eric dumps her twin sister Ursula and chooses her instead, and Monica comes unhinged when she suspects that her new maid is stealing her jeans, among other things.
