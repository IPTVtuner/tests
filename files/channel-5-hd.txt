Working in an up-market Manhattan venue, a handsome, materialistic young bartender stages an elaborate cocktail-mixing act with a flashy, older colleague. When the pair fall out because of a woman, the deflated young man heads off to Jamaica, where he finds a beautiful waitress who makes him think again about his decision to swear off romance.
