It's Christmas Eve 1850, and the melancholy Scrooge finds himself alone at home when he sees before him the ghost of Jacob Marley, his long-time friend and business partner who died seven years earlier. Marley warns Scrooge that he will repent, even in death, for all the suffering he has caused others, and he has only one chance to escape his fate.
