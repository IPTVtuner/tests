Multi Oscar winning musical, based on George Bernard Shaw's `Pygmalion', about a phonetics expert who, for a bet, takes on the challenge of teaching a Cockney flower girl to talk like a duchess. All the songs from the stage musical were retained, including `The Rain in Spain, I Could Have Danced All Night, With a Little Bit of Luck, and Wouldn't It Be Loverly'.
