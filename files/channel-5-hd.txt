Monica's first Thanksgiving dinner for the gang goes horribly wrong when they all get locked on the roof after watching a giant runaway balloon from the New York Thanksgiving parade. Elsewhere, Joey wins his first modelling gig as the poster boy for a venereal disease campaign, and Ross competes with his ex-wife to communicate with their unborn baby.
