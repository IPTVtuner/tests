It's Phoebe and Mike's big day, but all does not go to plan. Wedding planner Monica is driving the bride to distraction, New York is hit by its worst blizzard for 20 years, and Joey is taking his role standing in for Phoebe's incarcerated father far too seriously. Chandler and Ross are upset that neither of them has a role, until Mike needs to replace one of his groomsmen.
