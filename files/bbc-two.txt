Live coverage from Lord's as Isa Guha introduces the decisive match in the men's competition. Manchester Originals have been beaten in both the 2023 and 2022 men's finals, including a heartbreaking defeat by 14 runs to Oval Invincibles in 2023. Outstanding fast bowling saw Originals reduce their opponents to 34-5, but an unbeaten partnership of 127 from Tom Curran and Jimmy Neesham enabled Invincibles to post what proved to be a winning total.
