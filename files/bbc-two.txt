Natasha Raskin Sharp has a puzzle for passers-by in Brackley to solve. Her mystery object is heavy and made of cast iron with a brass opening. What could it be and why is it so important for one avid collector. The venue for the shopping showdown is an antiques centre in the Northamptonshire town. Engaged couple Aron and Charlie are bargain-hunting with Thomas Forrester, while married couple Lucille and Geoff are with Tim Weeks.
