Fellow musicians, journalists and fans celebrate Fleetwood Mac with a selection of their best loved songs. Fleetwood Mac are the great survivors of British and American rock music. For more than fifty years they've overcome break-ups and breakdowns to become one of the most successful bands of all time. They have sold over 100 million records worldwide, with their 1977 smash Rumours accounting for nearly half of those sales.
