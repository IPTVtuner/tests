Top criminal barristers Jeremy Dein QC and Sasha Wass QC re-examine their oldest case yet - the murder of a military veteran by his estranged wife nearly 200 years ago. Leicestershire, 1825. On the evening of 25 April, ex-soldier James Read was reported missing by his wife Hannah. A manhunt, spearheaded by Read's brother Thomas, found James's lifeless body in the Old Union Canal. As Hannah Read was the last person to see James alive, she became the prime suspect in connection with his death.
