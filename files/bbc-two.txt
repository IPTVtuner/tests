Two farming families rely on Ludlow's market in its ancient square to sell their produce. Father-and-son team David and George grow six varieties of apples that they turn into premium ciders, but rain at the market threatens to put a dint in their sales. Husband and wife Liam and Alice are trying to build a thriving market garden on their modest seven and a half acres. They have a secret sales weapon in the form of their four-month-old baby Sidney.
