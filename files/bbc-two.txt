Two farming families gear up for the horse carriage marathon at Ashfields Carriage and Polo Club in Essex. Three generations from a sheep farm in Newcastle make the 240 mile journey, but all eyes are on how their youngest, 16-year-old Daniel, will do. Jo Alvis and her daughter Katy, who has represented Great Britain in the junior championships, also have a lot to prove on the tricky obstacle course.
