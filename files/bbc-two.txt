Amanda Holden and Alan Carr are packing their boiler suits once again after bagging another one-euro house - this time, in the idyllic region of northern Tuscany. Falling in love with the romance and history of an old building, Alan purchases a dilapidated 17th-century house with a medieval watchtower in the rural hamlet of Fornovolasco, and ropes in best friend Amanda to spend their summer transforming it into another Italian dream home.
