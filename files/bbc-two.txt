Maya is ten weeks old and is starting to push the family to their limits. She is wreaking havoc in the house, destroying the bookshelf, getting into the fridge and ripping up the sofa. She is showing possessive behaviours with her toys and Kathryn and Sam are noticing that she is starting to bite hard too.
