Wales' favourite weatherman, Derek Brockway, walks the Dee Valley Way, a stunning 13-mile route which takes him from the pretty town of Corwen to its larger and more bustling neighbour, Llangollen. On the walk he learns about a warrior prince, re-opens a pub and leads a horse-drawn barge along the Llangollen Canal. Wildlife expert Lizzie Daly also sees how a re-homed family of beavers is settling in and Matt Bassett crosses the jaw dropping Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in a specially adapted canoe.
