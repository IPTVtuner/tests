Paul explores the lochs of Skye. He hears tales of the singer Donovan and his dream of a hippy colony; thrills at the sound of the pipes, tries on a jacket fit for a king, and goes in search of a Viking ship canal. After learning about the mythical female Celtic warrior and sorceress Sc√°thach, Paul has a lesson in spear throwing, before tackling one of the longest rock climbs in the Cuillin Mountains - the Dubhs Ridge. Journey's end is one of the finest mountain views in Scotland.
