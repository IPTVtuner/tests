The green, green hills of mid Wales are the setting for this episode. At a huge antiques fair in the Royal Welsh Showground in Builth Wells, two teams of friends each hunt for three collectibles to sell at auction, hopefully for a profit. On the red team are Ali and Gilly from Wiltshire, who met through historical re-enactments. Hoping to lead them to victory in this battle is expert Kate Bliss. In blue are pals Karl and Malcolm, who met at an online pub quiz.
