An escapee from Surrey challenges Alistair Appleton to find her the perfect property in a county and a country she's never been to before, Pembrokeshire in Wales. For a very top budget of Â£900,000, the wish list includes a remote period house with spectacular views. Alistair takes time away from the property search to visit a forward-thinking farm which specialises in edible insects.
