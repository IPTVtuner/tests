Rev Kate Bottley and broadcaster Ashley John-Baptiste are in the great outdoors to explore how making the most of the planet's resources might have benefits for us as well as the environment. Kate is in Wales as she discovers how some people find inner peace on a wire high above the cliffs of Anglesey, while Ashley meets a group of people aiming to clean up their neighbourhood to make it a nicer place to live for everyone.
