After racing through the neon-lit streets of ultra-modern Japan and South Korea, there is a split in the pack. The teams enter south east Asia for the first time, starting the third leg from the chaotic Vietnamese capital Hanoi. The competition intensifies as the team in last place faces elimination. They must race over 2,000km through Vietnam and into the Kingdom of Cambodia to reach one of the fastest-developing cities in South East Asia - Phnom Penh.
