Hop on board this episode of Bargain Hunt from Derbyshire as Natasha Raskin Sharp learns how trams once helped to deliver the mail. At the cost of a penny, passengers could post a letter in a box next to the driver, which would then be delivered by parcel boys. Can the teams deliver a profit of their own when they shop for antiques and collectibles in the town of Heanor? Danny Sebastian captains the red team, married couple Tom and Karen, as they hunt for a cat-related item.
