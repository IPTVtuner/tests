Sally Phillips meets Lemn Sissay, who spent years in the care system after being taken from his mother as a baby. His is a tale of lost Christmases and rejection before he found the voice and words that have made him one of the most celebrated poets in the UK today. As Sally discovers, it's a position that has now helped him bring the true meaning of Christmas to hundreds of other care leavers across the country.
