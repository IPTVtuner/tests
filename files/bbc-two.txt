Sabrina Grant presents as a team of expert crafters transform unused objects into contemporary and functional items. A sailing boat has washed up at the workshop today, ready to be transformed. It's from Caroline's sailing club and was damaged beyond repair in a storm. `Lucy' has been the boat that many club members learned to sail on, and so Caroline can't bear the thought of scrapping it.
