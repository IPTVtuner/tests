Live coverage as the Manchester Originals and the Welsh Fire get their bids for glory in the women's Hundred underway at Old Trafford. The Originals will be looking to improve on a poor tournament in 2023, when they won just two of their eight matches. The Fire fared much better and enjoyed an impressive run to the eliminator, only to suffer heartbreak when it was washed out, meaning the Northern Superchargers reached the final courtesy of their superior position in the group stage.
