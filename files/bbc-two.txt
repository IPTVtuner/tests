Clare Balding presents live coverage from the opening round of matches as Spanish sensation Carlos Alcaraz returns to London to defend his title against a stellar field. Nearly half of the world's top 50 tennis players are in action on the grass in west London, with a strong British quartet comprising Cameron Norrie, Dan Evans, Jack Draper and Andy Murray. British entries have won the men's singles title 31 times, with Murray the last Brit to do so in 2016.
