Dame Mary Berry knows a thing or two about cooking up a fantastic feast, so she is sharing her cooking skills with three novice cooks - fireman Mark, youth worker Callum and boxing instructor Thaer - who want to throw a spectacular afternoon tea to say thank you to Soraya, who runs a local youth charity. With Mary's help, can they pull it off and give Soraya a thank you surprise she'll never forget? Mary has also enlisted the help of Roman Kemp and Celebs Go Dating's Tom Read Wilson.
