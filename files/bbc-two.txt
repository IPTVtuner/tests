In the final episode of the series, Chris Packham and Michaela Strachan are bidding farewell to the nests they've followed throughout the series. The Springwatch celebration of 20 years of British wildlife broadcasting continue with favourite moments from the series and audience contributions. Meanwhile, Iolo Williams wraps up his whistlestop tour of Northern Irish wildlife, and there's hope that live badgers might help see out a spectacular season.
