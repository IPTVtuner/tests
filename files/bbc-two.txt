On the show are friends Ola and Rhesa from Leicester. Set a budget of just Â£3.50 they make some nifty ingredient choices to stay on budget, and the chefs are tasked with turning out healthy delicious dishes without breaking the bank. Rhesa is in the red tomato kitchen cooking with vegan ingredients alongside Indian Chef Romy Gill.
