Starting in January 1981, this is a look at the arrest, trial and conviction of Peter Sutcliffe, and the legacy for the relatives of his victims and the survivors of his attacks. Speaking to one of Sutcliffe's defence team as well as a leading barrister from the prosecution and journalists who covered the trial, Liza traces the story from the moment of arrest.
