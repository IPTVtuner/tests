Jacqui Joseph is at High Wycombe recycling centre in Buckinghamshire, scouring the car boots for unwanted items with profit-making potential. A country-style kitchen table is the ideal blank canvas for furniture painter Chloe Kempster, whilst restorer Katie Keat goes back and forth on the repair of a collectable rocking chair. For her own project, Jacqui has a lightbulb moment when coming up with a plan for an old garden parasol.
