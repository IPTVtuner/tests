Local rivals London Spirit and 2023's champions Oval Invincibles clash at Lord's, the 'home of cricket'. This fixture provided drama aplenty at The Oval in 2023 as the Spirit fell just three runs short in their chase of 190, with the Invincibles holding on for a last-ball win that moved them to the top of the table. Captained by Sam Billings, the Invincibles went on to win 2023's competition in this very setting - beating Manchester Originals by 14 runs.
