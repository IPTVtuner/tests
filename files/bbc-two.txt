Charlie Ross takes a trip to Knaresborough in North Yorkshire to explore the mysterious Mother Shipton's Cave, uncovering stories of a legendary prophetess and a well that turns everything it touches to stone! In Wetherby, two teams shop for bargains at an antiques fair guided by experts Izzie Balmer and David Harper. In red, it's friends Suzie and Rowan and in blue it's sisters-in-law Pauline and Pauline. With 60 minutes on the clock, the Paulines pick up a pith helmet but decide to march on.
