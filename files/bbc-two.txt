The big-hitting cricket action continues in the Hundred as Trent Rockets travel to Southampton to take on Southern Brave. The Brave are looking to better their campaign from 2023, when they qualified for the Eliminator only to lose by seven wickets to Manchester Originals at The Oval and miss out on a place in the final. The two sides met in Nottingham in the opening fixture of 2023's men's competition.
