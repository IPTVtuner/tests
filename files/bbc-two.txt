The Roadshow comes from the V&A Dundee, on the east coast of Scotland. Fiona Bruce will uncover the fascinating story behind the design of this landmark museum and the treasures it houses. Dundee produces an eclectic mix of finds from an exotic embossed bowl bought for Â£3 at a car boot sale to an impressive Japanese vase with an emotional back-story.
