Isa Guha presents live coverage of the third and final T20 women's international between England and Sri Lanka in Derby. England's side will be buoyant, having won two of the three T20Is they played against Australia in the recent Ashes series, which included a memorable victory at Lord's. They now face a Sri Lanka side they last met at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. That encounter ended in a victory for the home side, maintaining their 100% record in T20s against the Sri Lankans.
