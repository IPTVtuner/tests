It's the men's turn to take centre stage at London's famous venue as the top male players battle it out in what's likely to be their final tournament ahead of Wimbledon. An all-star entry list includes reigning Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz, British number one Jack Draper and American big-hitter Taylor Fritz. In 2024, the USA's Tommy Paul defeated Italy's Lorenzo Musetti in the final, with Paul returning this year to defend his title. Clare Balding presents.
