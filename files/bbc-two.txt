It promises to be a blockbuster Friday night in Glasgow, with box-office athletes including Noah Lyles and Yaroslava Mahuchikh in action as four world indoor champions are crowned. American showman Lyles set a personal best and world-leading time of 6.44 sec in the 60m last month and is targeting another gold tonight to add to his outdoor 100m and 200m global titles last summer.
