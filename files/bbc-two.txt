Hugh Dennis and Julia Bradbury venture across Britain's biggest county, Yorkshire, from the Moors and the Dales to the coast to discover how Britain's epic past lives on in the most fascinating stories and characters. Hugh takes the controls of a glider, and gets winched down into one of Britain's largest potholes on the end of a rope, past the tallest unbroken waterfall in Britain.
