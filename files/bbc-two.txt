Ugo Monye is joined by guests for highlights and expert opinion on a pivotal weekend of Six Nations action as defending champions Ireland welcome France to Dublin. With just one game to go after this round of fixtures, the outcome of Saturday's game could have a big say in whether the championship trophy stays in Ireland for what would be an historic third year in succession. Elsewhere, England takes on resurgent Italy, while Scotland welcome a beleaguered Wales to Murrayfield.
