A remake of `The Philadelphia Story', this film is about the society wedding of Tracy Lord to priggish George Kittredge. Her ex-husband lives next door, and is organising a jazz festival for the same weekend. The attentions of a reporter and his photographer cause her to rethink her upcoming nuptuals.
