Keepers Graeme and James travel to the other side of the world to help in the Australian bushfire rescue. Four of the park's koalas have come from the area of south Australia worst affected, and the staff feel a deep sense of connection and are moved to help. They film their experience as they witness the devastation caused by the bushfires. Kate rolls up her sleeves and helps to tackle the 100 kilos of dung produced daily by Anne the elephant.
