Hitchcock thriller in which a psychoanalyst falls in love with her new boss, knowing that he is an amnesiac who may be a killer and an impostor. Characteristically Hitchcockian twists blur reality and imagination as the psychoanalyst struggles to restore his memory. A dream sequence designed by Salvador Dali adds to the suspense.
