Derek and the team travel to Snowdonia to walk a section of the Slate Trail, created to promote the former slate mining communities in the area. The route takes him from Capel Curig, where he has a go at rock climbing, via the stunning Swallow Falls, to picturesque Betws-y-Coed where he is given a lesson in charcoal drawing.
