Presenter and wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan heads to Canada at the peak of bear season, to discover what life is really like in the tiny town that's become known as the polar bear capital of the world. Every autumn, polar bears gather on the shores of Canada's Hudson Bay, waiting for the sea ice to form so they can begin their winter hunt.
