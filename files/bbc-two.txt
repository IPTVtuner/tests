Highlights from the opening day of the 44th Ryder Cup between Europe and their old rivals the United States at the Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Rome, Italy. Europe's bid to recapture the trophy and maintain their proud record of having not lost on home soil since 1993 was boosted by Viktor Hovland's brilliant success in winning the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup titles in August. He's joined by Masters champion Jon Rahm and the talismanic Rory McIlroy, who competes for the sixth time.
