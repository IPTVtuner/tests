Paul Murton explores the River Garry. He hears tales of the clan chief Struan Robertson who fought in all three Jacobite risings, then discovers the geology of deep time, before restaging the Battle of Killiecrankie with just two men, a musket, and a broadsword. After surviving a highland charge, Paul falls off a bridge. Journey's end is on the beautiful Ben Vrackie, the `speckled hill'.
