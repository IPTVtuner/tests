New Year's Day is traditionally a day when we get outside and go for a gentle stroll to blow off the cobwebs from the night before and welcome in the coming year. Margherita Taylor goes for a wintry walk alongside the River Lea. On her journey, Margherita meets historian, Dr Jim Lewis, who describes its history from the ice ages until the present day.
