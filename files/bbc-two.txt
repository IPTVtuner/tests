Titch embarks on a very personal build, a vintage custom motorcycle to honour his late grandfather, a D-Day veteran and the inspiration for Titch's own military career. Corporal William Cormack served with 45 Commando, the same regiment Titch would go on to serve with 50 years later. But this is more than just a build for Titch. Once completed, he wants to ride the machine over to the D-Day beach his grandfather landed on.
