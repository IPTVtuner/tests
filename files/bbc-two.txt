It's the Young MasterChef final! There are only three rookie cooks left, and tonight they square off in two challenges that will shake things up and require next-level cooking. All they can do is lay everything on the line and expect some jaw-dropping surprises along the way. Things are about to get real. It's not going to be an easy ride, as judges Poppy O'Toole and Big Has kick things off with a gigantic task.
