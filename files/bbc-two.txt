The queen of baking meets the king of the dance floor, Anton Du Beke. Anton is a total novice when it comes to cooking but wants to learn so he can make food for the family. So far, the only thing he can make is eggs, and Mary is certain he can expand his repertoire. The pair are meeting in sunny Bournemouth on a rare down-day from Anton's tour. He's performed here hundreds of times but never gets a chance to enjoy all this seaside town has to offer.
