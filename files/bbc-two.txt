Sitting on the east coast of Jersey, and about 14 miles from the coast of Normandy, the small village of Gorey was, for hundreds of years the frontline of defence between the British Isles and its enemy, the French. Archaeologist Ben Robinson follows the story of this small village's history as an important military location, from the castle built in the 1200s to the experiences of the village in the second world war when occupied by Hitler's army.
