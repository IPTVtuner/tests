In a nostalgic episode of Inside the Factory, new presenter Paddy McGuinness visits the Warburtons bread factory in his hometown of Bolton, where he once worked as a youngster more than 30 years ago. At Warbies, as the locals call it, he catches up with old friends and learns how the machines, ovens and conveyors he once cleaned enable the site to produce 1.4 million loaves of bread every week.
