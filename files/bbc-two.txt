Eric Knowles challenges the people of Lincolnshire on their antiques knowledge. Can they guess his mystery item? It's from the 19th century, it can be made of pewter or tin, it has a pumping action and an ever so tedious link to Lincolnshire history. Over at Hemswell Antique Centres, the reds are blues are pumped up as they go head-to-head to see who can buy the best items to sell at auction. Up the road at North Hykeham is where they hope to make some profits, guided by auctioneer Colin Young.
