On Easter Sunday, Alexander Armstrong and Arit Anderson visit gardens expressing hope, joy and renewal. At the Bishop's Palace in Somerset, Alexander discovers why this place has been sacred for centuries and helps to create a colourful and uplifting work of art. Arit learns how the ancient trees at Scone Palace in Scotland will be given a new lease of life, and Alexander heads to his home county of Northumberland to tour a garden where humour is being used to plant seeds of change.
