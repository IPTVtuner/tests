Shopping against the clock is the red team, father and daughter Willy and Jess, and their expert Ben Cooper. Their competition is mother and daughter Tessa and Alice, guided by Kate Bliss. With a budget of Â£300 and just 60 minutes to buy three items, each team races around the stalls at a huge antiques fair, hoping to buy two challenge items and one more of their choice.
