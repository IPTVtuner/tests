Live tennis continues from the All England Club, where players are doing battle for a place in the Wimbledon semi-finals. In 2023, Jannik Sinner reached his first Wimbledon semi-final. The Italian's game has moved up to another level since then, winning the Australian Open at the start of this year, and he came to the 2024 Championships as the world number one.
