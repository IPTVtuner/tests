The first episode of the Bafta award-winning series as it returns to the north west, one of the areas hit hardest by the cost-of-living crisis. The ambulance service has increasingly become the safety net for those struggling to cope while still striving to deliver the very best care to a population of over 7.1 million amid the deepest crisis in the NHS's 75-year history. The shift begins with an emergency call to the North West Ambulance Service on behalf of an unresponsive patient.
