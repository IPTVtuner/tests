Tony Hunter is a washed up Broadway musical star, whose friends and Les Martin want to put him back on stage. They have an idea for a small show, which Tony agrees to do, but the show takes a different direction when a bigshot director, Jeffrey Cordova, gets involved, and brings in a leading lady who rubs Tony up the wrong way.
