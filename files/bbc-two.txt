Hugh Dennis and Julia Bradbury venture across the most stunning parts of Cornwall and Devon to discover how Britain's epic past lives on in the most fascinating stories and characters. Hugh experiences the full force of the Atlantic as he leaps from a sharp granite clifftop into a lashing sea - his first taste of coasteering. He also attempts to land on Britain's scariest helipad at the top of a lighthouse.
