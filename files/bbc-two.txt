Arriving at the barn with a painting in need of restoration is Gaspare Frazzitta. He's excited about enlisting the help of the barn's art conservator, Lucia Scalisi, to bring a beloved 1860s painting of his hometown Marsala, in Sicily, back from a sorry state. The painting was given to him by his grandfather, who he adored as a child. He worked in a winery for 50 years, which is where the painting hung.
