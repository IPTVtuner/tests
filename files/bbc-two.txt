Two stars of hit comedy series Derry Girls go head-to-head. Actors Tara Lynne O'Neill and Ian McElhinney pop to the shops of Aberdeenshire in their sporty 1970s MG BGT, impersonating cows en route. They each have a kitty of four hundred pounds and guides in the form of Paul Laidlaw and Natasha Raskin Sharp.
