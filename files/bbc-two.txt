Live coverage as Leigh Leopards take on Huddersfield Giants in the second round of the Super League. The Leopards have punched above their weight since returning to Super League two seasons ago, and have won the last two meetings between these teams. Adrian Lam's side have lost several key players in the off-season but have brought in others, including former New Zealand international Isaac Liu, who will bring his extensive NRL experience to their forward pack.
