Sit back in a comfy chair and watch Charlie Ross present a special show on a subject close to his heart - furniture! From side tables to chests of drawers, Charlie charts the evolving styles of furniture and takes us on a tour through the ages, from the Georgian era to the art deco years of the 1920s and 30s. Along the way, he uncovers items from the show's archive and counts down the most profitable pieces at auction.
