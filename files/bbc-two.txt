Charlie Ross is in Somerset for today's show. Two mums team up with their children and delve into the antiques and collectibles at the Bath & West Showground in Shepton Mallet. Experts Phillip Serrell and Tim Weeks are on hand to guide the reds and blues as they try to bag the most profitable items to take to auction. While the minutes tick away on the teams shopping, Charlie gets to see the workings of a clock that has kept time for the people of Wells for hundreds of years.
