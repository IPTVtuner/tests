Weatherman Derek Brockway is in the South Wales Valleys walking from Wales' highest town, Brynmawr, to the pretty market town of Abergavenny about nine miles away. On the way he meets celebrity artist Nathan Wyburn who creates one of his unique works and becomes friendly with some rare breed pigs. Wildlife expert and action girl, Lizzie Daly, goes paragliding over the Blorenge mountain and Matthew Bassett learns about an community enterprise which produced streamline furniture and fed families.
