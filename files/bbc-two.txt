In the Highlands, new entrant crofters Lynn and Sandra welcome more new sheep and take delivery of a batch of hens that they hope will lay the foundations of an egg empire. In Northern Ireland, the Rodgers family host a barbecue for the local Young Farmers Club, but it is no ordinary flame-grilled affair. In the Cairngorms, Raymond and Johnny gather the flock to wean this year's lambs and weed out any ewes that aren't fit enough to breed again on their rough land.
