Explorer Paul Rose, marine biologist Tooni Mahto and maritime journalist Frank Pope explore the wild seas around Scotland. The team travel to Bass Rock, one of the largest gannet colonies in the world, to try and find out why when most British seabird populations are in decline, the northern gannet is bucking the trend. Tooni joins a scientist in St Andrews Bay in search of the bottlenose dolphin.
