Pies and pasties take the hairy bikers on their longest trip in this baking series, from Cornwall to Scotland. Dave and Simon start in the far South-West cooking traditional pasties at Geevor Tin Mine in Cornwall. They then head northwards to the Midlands, and then on to Huntly in Aberdeenshire, where our hungry hairy bikers sample an extraordinary range of pies.
