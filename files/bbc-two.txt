Dion heads to the West Midlands and is impressed with the character features he finds in a two-bed mid-terrace. Martel is at a crossroads in Greater Manchester to see a handsome four-storey former bank crying out for some serious investment to give it a new lease of life. And Martin visits a three-bed semi near Walsall whose kerb appeal leaves a lot to be desired.
