Sisters Katy Yeandle and Emma Rees, who are from Brynamman, on the edge of the Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons), have set themselves an almost impossible task. They want to arrange an all-star charity football match between Wales and England. They have to find a venue, enlist celebrities and famous faces to play and find two big-name managers, not to mention the fact that they need to sell thousands of tickets. The only problem is that neither of them knows anything about football!
