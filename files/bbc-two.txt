Danny Sebastian is flying high at Yorkshire Air Museum, where he learns about 19th century aviator Sir George Cayley. But over in Wetherby, do the teams soar to success or crash to earth with their items? Piloting the reds is Caroline Hawley, while Colin Young captains the blues. Tasked with buying an item used for storage, the red team snap up a pine hall bench, while the blues leave it to the last minute to complete their challenge.
