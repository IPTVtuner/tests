The show comes from the beautiful grounds of Belmont House in Kent, where Fiona summons the crowds in style with the help of a 14th-century instrument, the Moot Horn. Fiona also meets comedian Michael McIntyre and finds out why he's about to don a disguise for an elaborate Roadshow prank for his Saturday night show.
