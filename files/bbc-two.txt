Eight northern history students are pursuing an undergraduate place at Oxbridge in the 1980s. Their headmaster is determined to see them break records and enlists a new teacher to coach the boys into intellectual shape. Seduced though they are by his promises, the boys are concerned that there is more to the pursuit of learning than exams and grades.
