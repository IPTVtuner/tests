Nigel Slater raids his cupboards, fridge and vegetable patch to create a week's worth of delicious meals. In this edition, he demonstrates how to make our ingredients go just that little bit further. Whether it's adding grated beetroot to make a tasty meatball supper feed the masses or putting the spotlight on a small garden harvest to make a sensuous pudding, Nigel's clever tricks and inspired ideas show that you can often make bountiful feasts with apparently few ingredients.
