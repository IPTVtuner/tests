Fiona Bruce and Philip Mould head to the Norfolk countryside on the trail of one of the 20th century's greatest artists, Henry Moore. They are investigating an intriguing sculpture that belongs to retired dairy farmer Neil Betts and his wife Barbara, who, over the years, have used the piece as a doorstop and even a water feature, when Neil draped a hosepipe over it. t was only when a friend suggested it looked very much like the work of Henry Moore that the Betts began to see similarities.
