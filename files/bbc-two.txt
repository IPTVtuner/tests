It's Comic Relief Day and the office is awash with wackiness. Keith is squeezed into a bright yellow Ali G costume, Sheila has become Wonder Woman and Gareth is hopping on one leg. The hilarity climaxes when Neil and Rachel stage an impressive dance sequence from `Saturday Night Fever' in the reception area. David, desperate to outdo them, embarks on his own truly horrendous and spontaneous dance.
