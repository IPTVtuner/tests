Highlights from Virginia of the opening day of the Solheim Cup, the most prestigious team tournament in women's golf, as Europe and the USA go head to head. Europe are the current holders, retaining the trophy after the teams played out a thrilling 14-14 draw in Spain in 2023. That had seemed an unlikely outcome after the USA raced into a 4-0 lead after the first session at the Finca Cortesin course.
