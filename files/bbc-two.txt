1587. William Shakespeare leaves the small rural town of Stratford to pursue his dreams of becoming a playwright in the dangerous, growing metropolis of London. Public theatre is red-hot modernity, and Shakespeare begins his journey at the very bottom. Inspired by the live fast, die young world he inhabits, he writes the schlock horror hit Titus Andronicus and a teenage romance where all the young people die: Romeo and Juliet.
