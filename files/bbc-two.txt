While the teams try to cut a sweet deal at an antiques fair in Wetherby, Caroline Hawley visits York, which for more than a century has been known as the chocolate-making capital of the UK. She learns how tins of chocolate were sent to local soldiers during World War I. Battling for bargains are grandmother and granddaughter Daphne and Emily, captained by Philip Serrell. Competing for even bigger profits are colleagues Phil and Sharmarley, skippered by Jonathan Pratt.
