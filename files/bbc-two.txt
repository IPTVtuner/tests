Newlyn is Cornwall's biggest fishing port, the harbour is home to over a hundred boats, and for generations fishermen from here have sold fish in the town's busy market. Not much has changed around here for nearly a hundred years, until now. Brexit is coming, and as the town prepares to navigate these uncharted waters, one man is at the helm, harbour master Rob Parsons. He's been in post for five years but is still regarded as the new harbour master.
