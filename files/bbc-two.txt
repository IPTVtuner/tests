Great Britain will be aiming to get among the medals in the women's team final as the World Gymnastics Championships continue in Antwerp. GB won silver on home soil in Liverpool in 2022, their best ever result at a World Championships. With four of those silver medallists - Alice Kinsella, Jessica Gadirova, Ondine Achampong and Georgia-Mae Fenton - all competing in Belgium, hopes are high for another podium finish.
