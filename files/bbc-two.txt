First through the workshop doors is Minty Barlow, with a miniature house from her childhood. It was originally part of a model village tourist attraction in her hometown of Cleethorpes. Minty's parents saved the house when the attraction closed in the 1970s and re-sited it in their garden. A pair of sturdy suede shoes are what evokes childhood for Bev from Nottingham. They're wrapped up in memories of her much-missed grandmother Betsy, who gifted them to her when she died.
