The quarter-final takes the sewers back to the golden era of the 1930s. Esme and Patrick set them a Pattern Challenge for a pair of women's sailor-inspired trousers with a complex bib-front button opening and equally tricky pockets. Then the sewers show off their ability to think on their feet when they are given men's shirts to turn into 1930s women's blouses.
