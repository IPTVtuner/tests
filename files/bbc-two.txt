Chris Jackson and his fellow geologists head to the Nyamulagira volcano, one of the most active yet least explored volcanoes on the planet. The team travel on a UN helicopter flight at treetop level to avoid being hit by ground fire, before landing as close to the active crater as they can. They then have only a few hours to gain as much data as possible to help predict future eruptions.
