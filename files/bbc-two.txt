Hugh Dennis and Julia Bradbury are in the Highlands of Scotland, Britain's wildest and oldest landscape. They explore a landscape built by volcanoes, earthquakes and ice, and discover how this dramatic past lives on today. Plus, Hugh takes a breath-taking ride across Loch Ness as he uncovers how the deepest lake in Britain set the stage for a British sporting hero.
