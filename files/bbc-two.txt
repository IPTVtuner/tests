Dallas Campbell and Dr Hannah Fry explore just what it takes to keep this city in the sky safe between between take-off and landing. Dallas discovers how pilots find their way across thousands of miles of sky at night. Hannah meets up with the air traffic controllers who are responsible for the busiest airspace in the world - over Atlanta in southeast America - and reveal just what is involved in coordinating the 100,000 flights that cross the globe every day, while avoiding collisions.
