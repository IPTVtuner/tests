Highlights from the final day of the 44th Ryder Cup between Europe and the USA in Rome, where the ever-thrilling singles contests decide who claims the famous trophy. Europe, whose ranks features the likes of Rory McIlroy and Masters champion Jon Rahm, haven't lost on home soil since 1993, but they are up against a US team loaded with talent that includes US Open winner Wyndham Clark and Open champion Brian Harman. Presented by Eilidh Barbour.
