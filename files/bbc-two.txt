Today, September 21
Legendary rock and roller Chuck Berry performs at the BBC Television Theatre in 1972. `Johnny B Goode, Roll Over Beethoven and Nadine' are just some of the highlights of this concert, shown in an extended cut. This version includes, for the first time, an epic rendition of `My Ding-a-Ling' that carries all before it and raises innuendo to an art form.
