Nigel Havers welcomes sellers of collectibles and curiosities to the Bidding Room's home in Edinburgh where they to ply their wares to five dealers. The first, hopeful seller is Dawn with a Georgian wine cooler, or cellarette, that would have once resided in a stately home but has lived in Dawn's Walsall flat for the past four years. Bought at a charity shop for just Â£8, the cellarette could carry a hefty price tag.
