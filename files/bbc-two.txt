Two teams target golden gavels as today's show comes from Nottinghamshire, home of legendary outlaw Robin Hood. Natasha Raskin Sharp meets master bowyer Keith Gascoigne, who shows her how to make a long bow. Keith has been making bows for 62 years. Some of them have helped to win gold at the Paralympics. Hoping to string together some profits are today's teams - police officers Dean and Sophie and mother and son Bharti and Anand.
