Highlights from Lord's of the fourth and final one-day international between England and New Zealand. The two teams famously played out one of the most amazing games of cricket ever at this venue in the 2019 World Cup final. England won that match after a 'super over', and another victory today will give them plenty of confidence ahead of the defence of their title in India next month.
