Highlights from the opening one-day international between England and New Zealand at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff in a repeat of the 2019 World Cup final. England famously won that match against the Black Caps in 2019, and they begin the defence of their title against the same opposition in India in less than a month's time. Both sides will be keen to lay a marker down in what is the first match of a three-game series.
