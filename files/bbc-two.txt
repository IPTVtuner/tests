Celia Imrie celebrates the cinema's marvellous movie musicals, venturing back through the BBC's archives to look at film's most joyous and arguably enduring genre. Interviews with some of the biggest stars and directors take us from the golden age of icons like Marilyn Monro, Jane Russell, Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire to the modern day triumphs of La La Land and The Greatest Showman. The programme also explores the connection between the box office charts and the music charts.
