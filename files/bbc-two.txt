Matt Baker and Margherita Taylor are visiting Romney Marsh in Kent, known for its sweeping skies, marshland and shingle beaches, and at this time of year home to tens of thousands of wintering birds. Margherita is at RSPB Dungeness to help the team set up special fencing in the reserve's lakes to help protect nesting birds from predators, and seeing how nature is reclaiming the huge concrete sound mirrors built after the First World War.
