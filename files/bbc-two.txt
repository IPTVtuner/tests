This is the story of 15 men and women and one life-changing year on the frontline of the most divisive conflict of a generation: the 1984 miners' strike. This documentary tells the story of this year-long conflict by combining archive footage with deeply personal testimony from striking and working miners, their families and the police - with many speaking for the first time.
