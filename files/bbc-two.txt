Betty Glover presents the best of the action as elite gymnasts from around the globe descend on Birmingham for the 37th Trampoline World Championships. All eyes will be on Britain's former individual world champion Bryony Page as she looks to put down a marker and fine-tune her routine ahead of the next year's Olympic Games. Page took silver in Rio 2016 and followed that with bronze at the Tokyo Games, and is hoping she can go one better and take gold in Paris.
