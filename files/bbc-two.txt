Live coverage of the conclusion to the women's road race in Switzerland, as the world's best female cyclists take on a demanding 154km course. Last year it was Belgium's Lotte Kopecky who won the coveted rainbow jersey, while the USA's Kristen Faulkner, who claimed Olympic gold in Paris this summer, could also be amongst the leading contenders. Presented by JJ Chalmers, with commentary from Simon Brotherton, Chris Boardman and Hayley Simmonds.
