Broadcaster Geeta Guru-Murthy and her brother, top TV newsman Krishnan Guru-Murthy, visit a cornucopia of antique shops in the Home Counties in a 1965 Ford Mustang. They're ably advised by cub reporters - and experts - Tim Medhurst and Steven Moore. The journalists also enjoy a colourful stop off beside the Thames, finding out how to create natural, sustainable clothing dyes from plants in the English countryside.
