Two of the UK's top criminal barristers, Sasha Wass QC and Jeremy Dein QC, investigate a case from 1922 in which a lowly hotel pantry boy was convicted for the murder of a titled lady. On 13 March 1922, after an evening playing cards, wealthy widow Lady Alice White retired to bed at the Spencer Hotel in Marylebone. During the night she was subjected to a brutal assault, and the following morning a chambermaid discovered her covered in blood and clinging to life.
