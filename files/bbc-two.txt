Dion brings some muscle to Newcastle-under-Lyme in the form of Steel from Gladiators, who helps him to wrestle an end-of-terrace into shape. Martin is in awe of a granite-built period property in Redruth, Cornwall. And from the Hammer archives, it's Dion again, who gets a makeover during a visit to a Rochdale barber shop.
