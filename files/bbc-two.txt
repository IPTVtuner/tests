Live and uninterrupted coverage as the 2024 Hundred campaign continues at pace as Welsh Fire take on Northern Superchargers in Cardiff. In 2023, the sides met at Headingley in Leeds in a match that will be remembered for a scintillating performance by England's Harry Brook, who hit a 41-ball century - the fastest ever in the competition's history. However, it was ultimately in vain, as Fire made light work of a run chase of 159, reaching it with ten balls and eight wickets still remaining.
