On Good Friday, Alexander Armstrong and Arit Anderson visit gardens of reflection and contemplation. At the remote Pluscarden Abbey in Scotland, Alexander helps harvest luscious apples and accompanies the monks singing midday psalms. Meanwhile, Arit walks in the footsteps of royalty in the glorious grounds of Sudeley Castle. And Alexander returns to his student haunts in Cambridge to discover a place designed to inspire joy, even on the bleakest days, in the university's botanic garden.
