Ainsley Harriott is asking, `are you game for game?' because today's dishes are all made with some of the least-used but most-tasty meats you can buy. The menu includes a venison dish from Rachel Khoo, Keith Floyd cooking with pheasant recipe, Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry's raised game pie, Raymond Blanc cooking with pigeon and a rabbit dish from Nigel Slater.
