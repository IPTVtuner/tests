Join Charlie Ross for today's Bargain Hunt, which comes from Shepton Mallet in Somerset. Good friends take on a married couple as they battle it out at the Royal Bath and West Showground in Somerset. Lending their expertise are Philip Serrell and Tim Weeks as they assist the reds and blues to bag a bargain, but who can buy the most profitable three items to take to auction? Charlie visits the studio of a local wood-tuning artist, whose work takes this ancient craft to a whole new level!
