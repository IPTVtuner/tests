Nigel and Benjamin, a father and son team, prepare for the farmers' market in historic Stokesley. These two are more like best friends and partners when it comes to running their rare-breed pig farm, and they are hoping for magnificent sales after a quiet last few months. Meanwhile, the Mellanby family, Anne, David and son Ian, have harvested some of the biggest veg ever seen for market day, and they are hoping Anne's homemade soup packs will be the winner of the day.
