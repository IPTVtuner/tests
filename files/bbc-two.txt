As a steam train races through the Devonshire countryside, Humphrey and Esther join the Shipton Abbott Players for a murder mystery rehearsal. Though Humphrey is only playing a detective, things turn from amateur to professional when the actor playing the victim is found dead with a real knife in his back. Life begins to imitate art as the pretend suspects become all too real, and the steam train is scoured for genuine clues.
