Two couples are preparing for big sales at Exeter's farmers' market today. Former archaeologist Janet and her husband Andy are hoping to sell some of their chickens to bring in the cash that will enable them to finish Uncle Pat's new home on their farm. Meanwhile, Liv and Henry are gearing up to sell all of their vegetables. They have big plans to create an outdoor kitchen on their modest seven-acre farm.
