The Hairy Bikers get groovy in Liverpool as they take a historic pub tour of some of the swinging 60s most important pubs. They meet John Lennon's drinking buddies from the 1950s to find out what he got up to over a pint or two before he was famous. Before performing their own song on stage at The Cavern, the duo discover why one nearby pub was a regular for 60s stars including Cilla Black, Gerry and The Pacemakers and The Beatles.
