Charlie Dimmock and the Rich brothers, David and Harry, look back at some of their favourite eco Garden Rescues: the ones that help Mother Nature. There is a garden that features a hedgehog highway for rescued hedgehogs in Andover, Arit builds a garden to attract bees, taking her design cues from beehives, and a battered old shed gets the ultimate recycled makeover from the team. There's also plenty of brilliant new gardening tips from Charlie and the boys.
