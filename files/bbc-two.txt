Dragons' Den star Sara Davies and Strictly's Amy Dowden are purring through the North-East in a 1985 Ford Cortina, perusing antique shops and putting Sara's business knowledge to good use. Along for the ride, and to share their know-how, are antique experts Natasha Raskin Sharp and Steven Moore. Kicking off in Jesmond, they drive all the way to Harrogate for their auction finale, turfing out the contents of antiques shops in Whitley Bay, Langley Moor and Hartlepool as they go.
