Live and uninterrupted coverage as the 2023 and 2022 men's Hundred champions, Oval Invincibles and Trent Rockets, come to blows in Nottingham. In 2023, when the two sides met at The Oval, an unbeaten 76 off 40 balls from captain Sam Billings helped the Invincibles to a convincing five-wicket victory to confirm his team's place in the final of the competition.
