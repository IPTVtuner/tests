Hugh Dennis and Julia Bradbury are in the South Downs, where they discover that this gentle, rolling landscape of southern England had a dramatic ancient past. Hugh gets to grips with the chalk of the famous white cliffs, a landscape built under the ocean - and finds out at first hand why chalk cliffs are one of the most dangerous places to climb.
