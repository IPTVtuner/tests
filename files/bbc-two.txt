In a leafy suburb of Hampshire, Natasha Raskin Sharp visits an unrivalled collection of Matchbox toy cars dating back to the 1950s. Collector Nigel Cooper reckons he has about 25,000 miniature motors, some he bought as a boy with his pocket money. Among his rarest models is a coronation coach and horses from 1953 with a surprising story. In neighbouring Surrey, two teddy-bear-loving teams compete for profits at a huge toy fair at Sandown Park Racecourse.
