Monty Don visits the world's 80 most inspiring gardens: this time, in South East Asia. Since the 19th century, Western gardeners have loved the tropical garden. Monty visits the archetype - the mysterious Jim Thompson's Garden in Bangkok. He seeks something more authentic in the Royal Palace gardens and the floating gardens of the canals of Bangkok. In Bali, his preconceptions are challenged again.
