Getting to work first is upholsterer Sonnaz, who has an appointment with Leigh from London. Leigh has brought in a tatty leather armchair with a request that this once luxurious seat can be transformed. Leigh has had the armchair since 1986, when he purchased it with the love of his life, Greg, who worked for the US Air Force. The pair met in Greece, where Leigh describes falling instantly for Greg, who then moved to the UK so the smitten couple could be together.
