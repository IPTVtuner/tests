Derek and the team travel to Ceredigion in West Wales on a walk that takes him from Bwlch yr Arian, where he feeds red kites, to Devil's Bridge, famed for its three-stacked bridges. On the way he also explores silver and lead mining in the area and goes on a hunt for pine martens. Meanwhile archaeologist Dr Erin Lloyd Jones joins a major hill fort dig and Onkar Singh Purewal spends night in a remote bothy.
