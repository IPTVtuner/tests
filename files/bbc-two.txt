EJ Osborne upcycles some old crates into an attractive cupboard, Siobhan Palmer shows us how to replace broken guttering, and we get the lowdown on how to restore an old wooden floor and create a loft hatch. Outside, we about growing potatoes and how to make a mobile planter. Back in his workshop, Jay shows us a few of his own home hacks, including building a simple shoe bench.
