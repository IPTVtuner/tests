Derek heads off on two contrasting walks at opposite ends of the country. First, he sets off from Llanberis along paths and tracks through an ancient oak woodland and on through the old Dinorwig quarry with its spectacular views of Snowdonia's highest peaks and the valley below. He then heads to Llanelli for an eleven-mile walk beside the Loughor estuary.
