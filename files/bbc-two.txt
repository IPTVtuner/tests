Saying goodbye to Puducherry, the group journey north to the foothills of the Himalayas for their final week in India. Following a treacherous drive up narrow, winding roads, they arrive at their new home on the outskirts of Rishikesh, ready to experience the spiritual side of life in northern India. After starting the next day with an outdoor group meditation session amongst the wild monkeys and spectacular views, Duncan and John waste no time exploring the bustling town of Rishikesh.
