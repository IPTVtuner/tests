Music Week brings three different musical and sartorial genres to the Sewing Bee. Sara Pascoe kicks off the week with a pattern for the parka coat that was adopted by Mod culture in the 1960s. With its classic fishtail vent and complex zip opening and hood, this is a feat of engineering. Country music is the inspiration for the Transformation Challenge, as the sewers take old denim and turn it into stage gear worthy of Dolly Parton.
