Joyce Conway is happy with her life, her boyfriend Conor loves her, she enjoys her job behind the scenes at the local radio station and her relationship with her father could not be better. Everything is turned on its head when a domestic accident requires a blood transfusion. She wakes up with memories which are not hers and finds recurring chance meetings with Justin Beckmann, a professor of art, extremely unnerving.
