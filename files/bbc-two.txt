Isa Guha presents live coverage from Lord's of the eagerly anticipated women's final of the Hundred. Southern Brave lost to Oval Invincibles in the 2021 and 2022 finals but made amends by beating Northern Superchargers in 2023's final, thanks largely to Danni Wyatt's innings of 59 and a quickfire 31 from Freya Kemp.
