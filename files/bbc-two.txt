As we head into winter, the days are getting shorter, the weather is turning colder, trees are losing their leaves, and wildlife is taking shelter. The countryside might appear dormant, but there is still lots to see, especially if you know what to look for! John Craven is in Oxfordshire where he learns about the signs provided by clouds, the behaviour of birds and a canon of country lore that might be of use at this time of year.
