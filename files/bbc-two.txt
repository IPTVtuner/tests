Bindu and Vivek have recently taken on their first garden after years of living in flats. Originally from India, Bindu grew up with a garden full of vegetables, nature and birdsong, and he would like to recreate a bit of that in their modest garden in Warrington. The garden is a sun trap, so they'd like some height and shade in the plot, as well as raised beds for growing fruit and veg.
