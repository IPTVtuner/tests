World renowned dancer and head judge of `Strictly Come Dancing', Shirley Ballas checks in to the B&B by the sea. Nestled on the wild coast of Northern Ireland, this nineteenth century Victorian villa is a very special place. Looked after by the host Sharon and her team, they ensure that all guests come away from the B&B with new skills and a fresh perspective. Sharon is joined by Michelin-starred chef Alex Greene, who runs the kitchen and makes sure every meal is a truly memorable experience.
