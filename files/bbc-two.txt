Sabrina Grant presents as a team of expert crafters transform unused objects into contemporary and functional items. Jesse took longer to learn how to ride a bike when he was young, due to a condition that affected his balance, so a bike from his youth has special meaning to him. He can't bear to let it go, but it is just taking up space now that he has outgrown it. Interior designer Shelley and metalsmith Leigh offer Jesse a choice between two very radical transformations.
