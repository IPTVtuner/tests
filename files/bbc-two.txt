Sally takes the Rev Richard Coles back to the church pew where he first found his faith to discover how Christmas has brought some of the most joyful, meaningful and sorrowful moments in his life. From childhood chorister and Communards fame to life as a vicar and the death of his beloved life-partner David, Richard tells a story filled with frank, funny and festive memories.
