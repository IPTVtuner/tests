In Scotland, Gregg and Chris visit a young family for whom mealtimes have become hard work. With a two-year-old and a four-month-old, life is hectic for parents Aliyah and Ajaz, and a lack of time isn't the only challenge the family face. Aliyah and Ajaz have very different tastes when it comes to food. Ajaz loves meat and spice and uses chilli to spice up everything he eats, but Aliyah prefers milder flavours and isn't keen on red meat.
