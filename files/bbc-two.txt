A top-flight barrister attempts to defend murder suspect Leonard Vole, who stands accused of murdering a wealthy widow for the fortune she left behind. To make matters worse, his alibi, provided by his wife Christine, falls down when it is revealed their marriage is not fully legal and she can be used as a witness for the prosecution.
