Fasten your cufflinks for an action-packed programme from Somerset. Presenter Christina Trevanion is joined by Stephen Redmond, who shares with her just a fraction of his huge collection of cufflinks. Stephen explains that, before cufflinks, shirts were fastened with ribbon or string until King Charles II chose to wear jewellery on his wrists. Among Stephen's favourite pieces are a pair of jewel-encrusted cufflinks once owned by entertainer Ernie Wise.
