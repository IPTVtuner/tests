Chef James Strawbridge visits Greyabbey House, hoping to create a menu which captures the history and character of the estate and impresses its owners, Bill and Daphne Montgomery. At the coast nearby, James uncovers how a slippery sea substance was once a major source of income for local workers and landowners, before getting a taste of the stuff harvested fresh from the water.
