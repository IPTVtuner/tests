Having met online and fallen in love just over a year ago, today's couple are calling on the help of Nicki Chapman to find them their very first home together in the East Sussex countryside. To better understand what living in this county is like, Nicki meets up with one of its residents, none other than fellow Escape to the Country presenter Alistair Appleton. Alistair welcomes Nicki to his beautiful, off-grid, 200-year-old former coastguard's cottage, which he calls home.
