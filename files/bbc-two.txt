A documentary on assisted suicide, authored by actor and disability rights activist Liz Carr. We may be used to seeing Liz in dramas such as Silent Witness, Good Omens or The Witcher, but now she's stepping away from the spotlight to pursue her greatest passion - debating why she believes we shouldn't legalise assisted suicide. As a long-term campaigner against that change, Liz fears disabled lives will be put at risk if the law is altered.
