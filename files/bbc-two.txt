Today's show comes from Staffordshire and north Wales, with two teams shopping for bargains on a budget. The red team, sisters Denise and Marie, are joined by expert Jonathan Pratt. Their motto is: 'We really didn't care how far we had to travel; it's all about winning that golden gavel!' Married couple Karen and Huw are in blue, guided by Irita Marriott. With an hour on the clock, both teams spot silver items, but do they have the mettle to part with their cash?
