It's the most wonderful time of the year... for bargain hunting! Eric Knowles and Father Christmas host an action-packed Christmas programme from Newark in Nottinghamshire. On the teams' Christmas lists are profits aplenty, as they dash around stalls bursting with antiques and collectibles. They'll be helped by two Christmas crackers, Raj Bisram and Izzie Balmer, as they gift their expert knowledge to the teams.
