Isolated since the time of the dinosaurs, New Zealand's wildlife has been left to its own devices - with surprising consequences.

From Kiwis with their giant eggs, to forest-dwelling penguins and helicopter-riding sheep dogs, meet the astonishing creatures and resilient people who must rise to the challenges of their beautiful, dramatic and demanding home.
