Ginny Buckley is in Wiltshire with a young couple from London looking for a new home to house them and their 5 guinea pigs. They have Â£600,000 to spend and would like enough land for some more, somewhat larger animals. Whilst in the county, Ginny also goes on an inland fossil hunt before helping to transform one prehistoric piece into stylish jewellery.
