In this special festive edition, celebrity contestants Kevin Eldon, Sarah Keyworth, Laila Rouass and John Whaite take on a series of quiz rounds selected by the host, quiz legend Richard Osman. A daily winner is declared following a quickfire round at the end of each show, and the scores are tallied across the week, resulting in an overall champion being awarded the House of Games Festive Trophy on Friday.
