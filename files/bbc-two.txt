Antarctica is the last great wilderness. It's the coldest, windiest, driest and most isolated place on Earth. Every winter, for over three months of the year, the sun never rises, but it's also home to the British Antarctic Survey's Halley Research Station. A veteran of living and working at Halley in the early eighties, BBC weatherman Peter Gibbs, makes an emotional return to this place he once called home. A place that, during his time, was key to the discovery of the Ozone Hole.
