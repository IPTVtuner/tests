Husband-and-wife cider-makers Liz and Mike are excited to bring their cider, made from eight varieties of apples, to the South of England Agricultural Show. But it's chucking it down, so they are praying their decision to turn some of it into mulled cider will save the day and bring in the much-needed sales. Meanwhile, Andy, his wife Anna and their two young children Lillie and Daisy have spent the last few days gearing up for the show's poultry competition. It's The X Factor for chickens.
