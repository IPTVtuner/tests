Jay Blades and the team bring four treasured family heirlooms, and the memories they hold, back to life. First to arrive at the barn is Vos van Marken. Originally from the Netherlands, Vos brings with him what looks like a leather-bound book. However, he soon reveals that hidden inside it is a secret radio dating from the Second World War. It was concealed by Vos's grandfather Anton so that he could listen to news of the Allied war effort.
