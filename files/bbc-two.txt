Now fully settled into their new life by the sea in Puducherry, the group celebrate Susie's birthday. Hoping to make it a night to remember, the senior citizens decide to throw a party, inviting local friends along too. Wanting to buy a special outfit for her big day, Susie takes style guru Zandra along to Puducherry's fashion district, while the men pay a visit to a French-influenced cafe to try to purchase a cake for the birthday girl.
