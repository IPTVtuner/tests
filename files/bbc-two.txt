Sarah Moore is at Keynsham recycling centre in Somerset, hoping to uncover three lucrative items amongst the skip-bound trash. She enlists the help of upcycler Sarah Peterson to work her magic on a trio of vintage chairs, and woodworker Bruce Faulseit gets creative when given a set of Victorian-era doors. For her own project, Sarah gets crafty with some old hanging baskets, but can all three of her finds make a profit?
