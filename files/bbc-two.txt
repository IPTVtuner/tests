Based on the life of John Merrick, a man born with a disfiguring disease who seemed doomed to a grim existence as a sideshow freak until taken in by a London surgeon and introduced to society. Despite his dreadful experiences, Merrick is a gentle, intelligent soul and becomes a popular guest in Victorian drawing rooms - but only if his deformed features are completely covered.
