Live women's rugby union from Cardiff Arms Park, where Wales and Scotland get their 2024 Six Nations campaigns under way. The Welsh side won 34-22 in Edinburgh last season but had to stage a remarkable second-half comeback on the most recent occasion that the sides met, in Cardiff in 2022. After trailing 14-7 at half-time, they rallied to win 24-19.
