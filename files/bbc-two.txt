John Craven visits Farmoor Reservoir in Oxfordshire, where many bird species find sanctuary in the cold winter months. John joins up with a local bird spotter to hear about the vast array of species that call this place home during winter. He also meets a biologist who has created a series of ponds on the reserve, which are some of the most monitored in Europe. John discovers these wetland habitats are important for all sorts of life in winter - above and below the surface.
