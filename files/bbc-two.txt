Martin is in Warwickshire to see a property above a former brewery with a quirky layout and a holey roof. Dion heads to Staffordshire to visit a three-bed mid-terrace with a huge back garden boasting elevated views over Stoke-on-Trent. And we return to Nottinghamshire to find out how the story ends for a couple who bought a former farm building at auction and planned to turn it into their forever home.
