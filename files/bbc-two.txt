Coverage as non-league Bromley take on League One's Blackpool, with the Londoners hoping to reach the FA Cup second round for the first time in 78 years. Bromley's manager, Andy Woodman, is the best friend of England boss Gareth Southgate and already has cup pedigree, having led his side to victory at Wembley in the 2022 FA Trophy final against Wrexham courtesy of a Michael Cheek goal. Cheek has also been in fine goalscoring form this season, helping his team mount a promotion challenge.
