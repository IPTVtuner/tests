Fiona Bruce and Philip Mould investigate a charming little landscape of a French village with a river running through it, purported to be by one of the founding members of the 19th century Impressionist movement, the British artist Alfred Sisley. Its owners, Americans Kim and Chuck, bought the work at auction near Chicago and believe it to be genuine.
