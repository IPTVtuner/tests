David Dickinson and a team of antiques dealers visit Colwyn Bay, to give locals a chance to put their valuables into auction or accept a cash sum. Helen Gardiner finds out that sealing a deal for a collection of 1950's Dinky toys is far from child's play; Karen Dalmeny duels it out for a commemorative sword and Corrie Jeffrey's enticed by an eighteenth century snuff box that's not to be sniffed at.
