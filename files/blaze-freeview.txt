Coalville in Leicestershire is the location today for David Dickinson and his team of James Layte, Tony Geering, Alison Chapman and Ian Towning. Amongst the items brought in are an Art Nouveau stamp box, a veterinary kit from the 1800s and a watch bracelet that once belonged to blonde bombshell actress Diana Dors.
