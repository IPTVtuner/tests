Today, December 14
David and the dealers rock up in Llandudno. The Duke puts his hand in his pocket to help one seller travel to see her family, James Layte has his sights set on a profit when he snaps up a telescope from the Napoleonic era, and there's a huge surprise in the den when a ring thought to be worthless makes the surprised owner a stack of cash.
