David Dickinson and his team of antique dealers travel to Stockport to give members of the public the chance to put their valuables into auction or accept a cash sum. Brenda Haller encounters a stationary box worth writing home about; a maritime picture leaves David Hakeney awash with wonder, but it's a pocket watch and set of sovereigns that turns the den into a gold mine today.
