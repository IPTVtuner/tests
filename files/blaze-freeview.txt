Historic Tatton Park in Cheshire plays host to David Dickinson and his team of dealers. A collection of crockery, jewellery and ornaments ensure the dealers get their cash out to tempt today's sellers. Plus, there's much excitement as a collection of Coronation Street autographs show up on James Layte's table.
