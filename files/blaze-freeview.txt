Tony Robinson hikes 45 miles through the Weald in Kent and the Downs of East Sussex to discover the area's rich and surprising Tudor heritage. At the impressively preserved Penshurst Place, author Philippa Gregory helps Tony relish the fate of the Grand Duke of Buckingham at the hands of the young Henry VIII. Tony finishes in Lewes, where he relives one of the more brutal monastic dissolutions.
