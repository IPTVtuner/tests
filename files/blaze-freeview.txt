Tony's walk takes him back to 1940 when the sleepy county of Dorset became the frontline in the war against Hitler. His five-day, 60-mile walk along the Jurassic coast reveals the county's hidden World War II story. Starting by the defences on Chesil Beach, Tony's journey encompasses stunning scenery and amazing acts of ingenuity and bravery as he heads east to finish in Swanage and Studland Bay.
