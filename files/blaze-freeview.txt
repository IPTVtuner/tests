In January 2012 Italian divers discovered the wreck of a massive plane off the coast of Sardinia. At a depth of 65 meters (213 feet) lies a Messerschmidt `Gigant', the biggest aircraft to fly in WWII. The find was a sensation, as none of Hitler's other mega planes survived the war, and no other wreck has ever been found.
