The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon are known to history as the Knights Templar. They were among the most wealthy and powerful of all of the western military orders and for the 200 hundred years of their existence, were at the forefront of Christian finance. Officially endorsed by the Catholic Church around 1129, the Order grew rapidly in membership and the Templar knights, in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross are the most potent image of the Crusades.
