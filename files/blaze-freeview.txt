Today, April 11
It's another day in the dealers' den. The show comes from the market town of Banbury and there are plenty of items through the doors including a very attractive Chinese bronze and a collection of WWII memorabilia, also, a local expert pops in to see 'the Duke' with a painting from a prolific English artist.
