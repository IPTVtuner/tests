Today, April 21
Today, David and his four dealers arrive in the Lincolnshire town of Gainsborough. The locals have turned out in their hundreds, hoping to seal the real deal. On today's show, Cheryl bids for an ornate tobacco jar, Hoggy takes a punt on some collectable rock and roll pictures and David Hakeney splashes the cash for a bit of bling.
