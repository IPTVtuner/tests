Today, October 29
David Dickinson is in Loughborough for today's edition of the antiques show with Simon Schneider, Mark Stevens, Michael Hogben and Jan Keyne. A World War II aviator's mask arrives on Mark's table, what looks like an old tin turns up for Simon, and a fine dining canteen of cutlery lands on Michael's table.
