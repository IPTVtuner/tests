Today, October 19
Stoke-on-Trent plays host to David Dickinson and his team on today's show. Michael Hogben has his work cut out with a seller who has brought in a set of World War II medals, Brenda Haller tries her best to buy a silver fruit bowl, and one seller drives a hard bargain for his racehorse bronze.
