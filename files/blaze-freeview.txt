David Dickinson and antique dealers Tim Hogarth, Brenda Haller, James Layte and Tony Geering visit Matlock in the Peak District, giving locals a chance to put their valuables into auction or accept a cash sum. Items brought along include a Christmas card from the Royal Family, a Hotspur Comic print and everyone's favourite, a Moorcroft bowl.
