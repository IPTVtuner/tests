"Killer Couples" is in the same vein of the long-running true-crime series "Snapped," which tells stories of people who commit murder or attempt murder, but with a focus on couples who commit crimes. Using re-creations and firsthand accounts, each episode digs into a case, telling the story of the couple's romance, how the relationship evolved from love to manipulation, and what ultimately led the couple to commit the crime. The stories range from teenage lovers who go on a multistate crime spree to lesbian lovers who want to eliminate one of their husbands.
