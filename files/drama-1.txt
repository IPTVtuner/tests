Today, September 17
Jonathan and Maddy are having a hard time convincing the police that they aren't involved in the murder of Felicity Vale. Matters aren't helped by the fact that Maddy has been less than complimentary about the detective in charge of the case in one of her books. Jonathan begins to suspect that Kitty may not have witnessed a murder after all. Do the healing hands of Felicity's housemate Clare hold the answer?
