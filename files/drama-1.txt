Danny plays art dealer as the gang pick sharp-tongued gallery owner Meredith Gates as their next mark. However, Gates is very astute when it comes to art and it seems that the team may have bitten off more than they can chew with the feisty collector. The team soon realise they must be on top of their game, or they risk coming out with nothing.
