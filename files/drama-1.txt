A body is found, and Rebus is convinced the murder is an underworld revenge killing, despite the different theory of the Scottish Crime Squad. Rebus also has to contend with a spate of racist attacks from a far-right Nationalist group which has become more active, and soon finds evidence to link the two cases.
