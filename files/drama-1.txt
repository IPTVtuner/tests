The grifters take on Dexter Gold, the greedy, smooth-talking owner of a corrupt gold exchange. The con is to pose as a renegade army unit in possession of a hundred bars of stolen Libyan gold, but can they pull it off without reprisals? Meanwhile, someone has defaced Eddie's prized picture of Ian Rush, so he bars the gang until the culprit owns up.
