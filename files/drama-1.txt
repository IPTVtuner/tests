Gordon, Compo's shy nephew, has at last overcome his timidity and is getting married to Josie. To Compo it is to be the festive occasion of the year. He has had a bath and borrowed one of Clegg's suits to wear with his large corsage and wellies. Foggy is filled with apprehension - and he has cause to fear, for accidents start to happen even before the bride and groom can agree to `honour and obey'.
