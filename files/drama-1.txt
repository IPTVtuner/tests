With fresh evidence of Jim Coaver's involvement in the attacks on MI5 and the government's proposed partnership talks with Russia, Harry kidnaps his former Cold War colleague, but the interrogation does not go to plan. Harry suddenly realises that he has been looking in the wrong place. Possibly Jim is the innocent party after all, and the real villain lies in another quarter?
