When the body of a missing prostitute is found, Rebus is haunted by a case from 20 years before. The killer was never found, but Rebus remained convinced that rich kid Daniel Raeburn was responsible. Now a respectable Edinburgh MSP, Daniel protests his innocence. As Templer and the team close in on prime suspect Martin Cowan, Rebus doggedly pursues Raeburn and discovers that gut instincts are sometimes open to interpretation.
