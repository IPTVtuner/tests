Buoyed by the launch of his memoir and today's speech to investors, Guy is brought crashing down to earth when someone from his past turns up and reopens old wounds. Fletch brushes it off at first, but when an unexpected case comes to AAU, he is forced to come to terms with Mikey's problematic behaviour. Ric is confident as he campaigns for the deputy CEO role, but hits a stumbling block when it turns out he doesn't have as many friends on the board as he once thought.
