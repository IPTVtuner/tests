Lenny Spearfish has had an impressive run of good luck since signing a deal with the devil: he's become an instant millionaire, survived a shooting, and seen an assassin collapse in front of his very eyes. When Jonathan and Maddy meet Spearfish and his deeply religious wife Alice through mutual friends, they are intrigued by his story, and suspect he may be getting help from somewhere other than Hell.
