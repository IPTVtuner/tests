The finger of suspicion points squarely in Lovejoy's direction when some valuable treasure goes missing from Wakering Hall. His delight at welcoming a cousin from across the pond is severely dampened when the light-fingered relation flees Stateside clutching the priceless loot. Lovejoy must therefore travel to North Carolina, where he must confront his conniving colonial cousins.
