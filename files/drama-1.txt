Drama +1
Today, November 19
It is 1968, and the shame of illegitimacy still burns the cheeks of single mothers and the families who force their unmarried daughters into `mother and baby homes'. When the adopted child of a middle-class couple is kidnapped, suspicion falls upon the baby's birth mother. However, Gently and Bacchus's investigation into the mother and baby home itself reveals a much darker side to this hothouse of morality.
