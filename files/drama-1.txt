A priceless porcelain figure of the mystic monk Sikoto-no disappears whilst on loan to Thelma Bailey, curator of a small town museum. The train of tragic events that follows appears to be a manifestation of its destructive nature. Jonathan and Carla are soon called in to investigate, the trail taking them deep into a mysterious wood where a gnarled old beech tree may hold the key to the puzzle.
