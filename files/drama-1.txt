Mickey crosses paths with Victor Maher, an ex-fraud squad officer, now head of security at a bank. Maher blackmails Mickey into helping him catch bank robber Sam Richards by infiltrating Richard's team of robbers. Albert Stroller, who has had dealings with Maher in the past, warns Mickey that the ex-cop is very good at what he does and that Mickey himself is as much the prize as Richards.
