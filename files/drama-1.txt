Norman Stangerson is temporophobic: terrified of the relentless passage of time. Despite this, he's doing rather well for himself, hopping back and forth across the Atlantic in his job. Norman's world falls apart, however, when his wallet is supposedly found at a British restaurant, even though Norman swears he was with colleagues in New York City at the time. It is then up to Maddy and Jonathan to solve the mystery.
