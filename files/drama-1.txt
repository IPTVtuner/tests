Former 70s sex kitten Jacqui Jordan has an accident in her garden one morning, leaving her in a fatal coma. Yet she is seen up and about later that day, having a conversation with an impeccable witness in Crooked Lane. The witness, Kathleen Gilmore, is convinced she has seen a ghost, or an out-of-body manifestation. Jonathan Creek must now throw some light on the problem, with more than a little help from his fan club.
