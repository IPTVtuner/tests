Today, January 02
The `divinely decadent' Berlin cabaret scene is in full swing when a young and wide-eyed Christopher Isherwood arrives in the city to stay with his close friend and occasional lover, the poet WH Auden. To Isherwood's reserved English sensibility, the city's thriving gay subculture is thrilling. However Christopher soon finds himself heartbroken after the failure of a hopeless love affair, and so sets out on a process of self-discovery.
