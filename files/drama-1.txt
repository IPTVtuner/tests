With tensions between Russia and America running high over US plans to place missile defence shields in former Soviet countries, and the news that a Sugar Horse asset has been found dead, it seems that Britain is caught in the middle of what could be a nuclear showdown. Meanwhile, Harry is imprisoned and accused by MI5 of being the Russian mole, whilst Lucas and the team try to prove his innocence on the Grid.
