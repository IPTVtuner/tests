DI Chandler, DC Miles and the team investigate a series of brutal killings and maimings. Local history expert Buchan suggests that London once more has a copycat killer - only this time the murders mirror killings by the Kray twins in the 1960s. Miles and Chandler refuse to believe Buchan's theory since the Krays are both dead - but is Buchan on the right path?
