Jonathan Creek returns to explain a series of odd disappearances in a `haunted' room at the house of a master illusionist. When a young woman falls victim to `The Nightmare Room', the fearlessly sceptical Joey Ross finds herself working alongside lateral thinker Jonathan Creek as they try to discover what happened to her friend. Who is behind the abduction, and what does the portrait of a grinning man mean?
