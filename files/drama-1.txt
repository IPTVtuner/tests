Ros's membership of Yalta is revealed after the organisation informs her of its plan to overthrow the American government. Working for both sides becomes her only option if she is to nullify the threat and save her own life, but as Harry himself leads the team into the traitors' headquarters hoping to unmask the ringleaders, it might all be too late to stop the operation codenamed Floodland.
