Having been humbled by Yalta's attack on their satellite network, the US is planning air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The team are suspended from the Grid following the Ros Myers affair and, when utterly impotent and isolated, an old adversary of Harry's appears out of the woodwork to inform them of a bomb he's planted in London. Either innocent civilians or the team will perish, but who is really behind the threat?
