Mickey implements an unorthodox con to target two sham health product salesmen, Dean and Dana Deville. They are going to sell the Devilles a fake diet treatment, but two heists, a long convincer and a lot of weight loss make for a risky endeavour. Perhaps this time the grifters really have gone too far? Meanwhile Eddie finds love.
