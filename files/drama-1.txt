Drama +1
Today, February 10
A second mass murder occurs with no signs of an obvious break-in and no forensic evidence for Chandler and the team to use. The crimes begin to take on an almost supernatural edge and local residents wonder how they can sleep soundly in their beds when doors and locks offer no protection from whoever is responsible.
