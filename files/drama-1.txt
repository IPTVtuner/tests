A convicted murderer manages to escape from Dalziel's custody during a rainy night on the desolate moors. The next day, the badly mauled body of a young barmaid is discovered. Dalziel and Pascoe's attempts to recapture the convict and investigate the murder lead them to face the myth of the Barguest, a monstrous black dog that roams the moors, and to a pub which is seemingly cursed.
